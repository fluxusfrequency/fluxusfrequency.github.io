<p><img src="https://quickleft.com/wp-content/uploads/priritize-tasks-300x202.gif" alt="how to prioritize your best features"/></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>The tech world moves fast. It&rsquo;s not uncommon for a startup to scale from two people in a coworking space to a team of thirty or more in a matter of months. Just as often, the team shrinks again due to sudden market changes or errant developers moving on to the next big thing.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;re getting ready to rebuild your business, it can be hard to know where to begin. There are so many things to do, from marketing, to onboarding a new team, to deciding what to build next.</p>

<p>In <a href="http://quickleft.com/blog/ramping-up-developers-on-code">part one of this series</a>, we talked about some of things you can do on the technical side to get your dev team up and running with a minimum of fuss.</p>

<p>In this, the second and final part of this series, we&rsquo;ll focus on how to prioritize your best features. We&rsquo;ll look at how to decide what you should get rid of and what you should pull out into its own codebase. Then we&rsquo;ll tackle the question: what to build next?</p>

<h2>Finding Your Strategic Direction</h2>

<p>Assuming your development team is all ready to go, you might start to ask yourself: &ldquo;what do we build next?&rdquo;</p>

<p>But before you assume that you&rsquo;re ready to start prototyping and shipping new features, you should take a hard look at what&rsquo;s already there. Then, ask yourself if you shouldn&rsquo;t do a little housekeeping first.</p>

<h3>Take An Inventory</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s a good idea to take an inventory of the workflows and features that are already in your application. Make a list of ways that users interact with the system. You could even consider <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/happy-sad-evil-weird-feature-planning">writing user stories</a> for the functionality that&rsquo;s already there.</p>

<h3>Consider Removing Features</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a fun exercise. Once you&rsquo;ve created a list of your use cases, go through and assign a value to each based on how important you think it is to your users. Then check out your analytics tool and compare your assumptions to the <em>actual</em> engagement of each feature.</p>

<p>When you&rsquo;ve completed this process, you can begin to reprioritize. Are there secondary features that aren&rsquo;t seeing much traffic? Maybe they were failed attempts to grow your user base that you never got around to pulling out. Maybe there are features that used to be popular, but a competing technology rendered them obsolete. Can you identify any parts of the app that require a lot of upkeep, but aren&rsquo;t really serving your users? Here&rsquo;s the tough question: what can you remove?</p>

<p>Think about <a href="https://basecamp.com/">Basecamp</a>. They used to be <a href="http://37signals.com/">37Signals</a>, but in February 2014, they announced that they were dropping support for all of their applications aside from Basecamp. They whittled it down to what they knew was successful so that they could focus all of their resources on it.</p>

<p>You can do the same thing on a smaller scale. Focus on the part(s) of your application that made the business a success in the first place. Do your marketing and landing pages drive users to interact with that feature? Is it easy to get to? Is it easy to <em>use</em>? Are there other features or workflows that are getting in the way of users finding their way there?</p>

<p>If you can identify some features that you can lose, you can focus your resources on the things that bring users to your site. You free up energy to refine them and make sure they&rsquo;re solid and bug-proof. It also gives you room to experiment with <em>new</em> secondary features without overwhelming your users. I know one company with a well-established product that follows this rule: &ldquo;you can&rsquo;t add a feature unless you remove one.&rdquo;</p>

<p><a href="https://gettingreal.37signals.com/ch05_Start_With_No.php">Don&rsquo;t build yet</a>, even if you have customers clamoring for it. Remove the cruft first. Think of it as refactoring at an application level.</p>

<h3>Consider Splitting Out Services</h3>

<p>In <a href="http://quickleft.com/blog/ramping-up-developers-on-code">part one of this series</a>, we talked a bit about refactoring your application code. If you do a little bit of refactoring, and find yourself getting into this whole code extraction thing, maybe you want to go whole hog. Talk with your engineers about whether it makes sense to extract an entire part of your app into a separate service. Some good candidates include: <a href="http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2015/03/01/serving-custom-json-from-your-rails-api-with-activemodel-serializers/">exposing a REST API</a>, <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/wrapping-your-api-in-a-ruby-gem">creating a gem</a> to talk to your API, <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/how-to-create-and-expire-list-items-in-redis/">storing data that&rsquo;s shared with other applications</a>, or integrating with an Elastic Search service.</p>

<p>In some cases, starting a whole new code base can take a lot of time, and might not be worth it. On the other hand, if it&rsquo;s hard to make changes in the code you&rsquo;ve already got, sometimes extracting a service can actually speed things up. With a smaller surface area, and code written by people who <em>currently</em> work for your company, it&rsquo;s easier for folks to grok what&rsquo;s going on. This leads to faster development.</p>

<p>If you do go down the road of extracting services, your team should take the time to define clear boundaries between the old app and the new one, and describe how they will interact in detail. For example, if you&rsquo;re pulling out an API, you might want to come up with a sample JSON response and the HTTP Status Codes that will be used <em>before</em> you build it. Defining the limitations and structure beforehand can keep a project like this from dragging on endlessly.</p>

<h3>Use MVP To Figure Out Where To Go Next</h3>

<p>A lot of people don&rsquo;t realize it, but a Minimum Viable Product (MVP) isn&rsquo;t just the first version of the thing you&rsquo;re building. It&rsquo;s actually a process. A way of testing out the market to find out whether things you <em>think</em> that people will like are <em>actually</em> things that people will like.</p>

<p>If you haven&rsquo;t tried driving your business this way, you should! Instead of just guessing what you should build next, or building whatever customers ask for, you can actually find out using research and numbers. Customer requests are great, but spiking on new features and getting information from analytics and customer feedback can really help you hit a home run.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s basic gist of MVP. You start with an idea. It might be an app. It might be a feature. Either way, you build <em>just enough</em> to find out whether it makes sense to invest further in your idea. How do you find out? Measure user response with clicks and sign-ups that actually go nowhere, and use analytics, questionnaires, interviews, and emails. When you&rsquo;ve got data, analyze it. Do they love it? Keep going! Was it a partial success? Ask yourself: what can I keep, what can I lose? Otherwise, pivot or abandon your idea. Build something else. Measure its success. Analyze your data. Repeat.</p>

<p>For a more specific walk-through of using MVP to drive your business direction, check out my <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/actually-mvp">Actually MVP post</a>.</p>

<p>Assuming you&rsquo;re getting ready to scale up your app, you probably already have some ideas about what you want to build. Stop for a second, and consider adding a couple of months of MVP-driven development to your roadmap instead.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>In this post, we looked at ways to find your strategic direction when beginning work on a product that&rsquo;s been on ice for a while. We talked about how to decide what to remove, what to extract, and what to build next. Hopefully, the process I&rsquo;ve outlined here has got you thinking about how to prioritize your best features. Now, it&rsquo;s up to you to build <em>the next big thing</em>. Best of luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/ramping-up-developers-on-code/">The Quick Left Blog</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Remember the glory days? Your company had it all! New signups every day. Coverage on the hottest blogs. Money was rolling in hand over fist. All thanks to your hot app. You and your goons really nailed it when you followed an <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/actually-mvp/">MVP</a> process and built just the thing the market was looking for.</p>

<p>But then something happened. You shifted focus to integrating with another company&rsquo;s API. Or you lost your entire developer team. Slowly, kudzu vines covered over what was once a glorious app. The technology you used to build grew outdated. Bugs accumulated, but there was no time to fix them. You shed a single tear when you thought back to the glory days.</p>

<p>Finally, a new day dawned! You got a funding round! You&rsquo;ve just hired a new team of developers. They start next week. You can&rsquo;t wait to get them slinging code. But are you ready? Starting a new team on an old app isn&rsquo;t as easy as handing them laptops and saying &ldquo;clone down the repo&rdquo;. In this post, the first of a two-part series, we&rsquo;ll take a look at some advice you can use when ramping up developers on code in a legacy application. When we&rsquo;re through, you&rsquo;ll be ready to let the good times roll again!</p>

<h2>Have An Easy Setup Process</h2>

<p>Getting developers set up on a project can be time-consuming. Maybe you&rsquo;re planning to write off two days for each person to set up their laptop, get the application and its dependencies installed, and familiarize themselves with the codebase. If it&rsquo;s just one or two developers, you can probably justify four days of lost time. But what if you&rsquo;re bringing on a team of ten? And what if they could get set up in one day? Or even half a day? That would be 15 days spent on developing new features and bringing in more money!</p>

<p>So how can you get them up and running faster?</p>

<h3>Documentation</h3>

<p>Documentation is <em>so</em> important. I can&rsquo;t possibly recommend it enough. As a consultant, it&rsquo;s one of the first things I look for when checking out a new code base. Docs are the most efficient way to get a new team member up and running. If they&rsquo;re up-to-date, new devs can <em>read</em> about the project architecture and setup process, instead of having one of your more experienced developers take the time to sit down and explain it.</p>

<p>There are many effective ways to make documentation accessible to your team. I&rsquo;ve seen companies have success with their <a href="https://help.github.com/articles/about-github-wikis/">GitHub project wiki</a>, <a href="https://www.atlassian.com/software/confluence">Atlassian Confluence</a>, a <code>docs</code> folder in their app repo, or a separate <code>docs</code> repo on GitHub.</p>

<p>Document as much as you can. Your main application should have a thorough <code>README</code>. It&rsquo;s the first thing people will see when visit the GitHub repository. If you&rsquo;re running separate server and front-end apps, there should be a way to understand what has to be done to get them to talk to each other in development. How do you install the dependencies? How do you run the tests?</p>

<p>Sometimes, project setup can get held up by weird system setup issues. Maybe the app used to run on a pre-Yosemite version of OS X, but when you try to install it on Yosemite, it runs into problems with Nokogiri. I recommend creating a <code>troubleshooting</code> document and putting errors and their fixes into it. At <a href="https://quickleft.com/">Quick Left</a>, we cut our dev setup time by several hours when we introduced a <code>troubleshooting</code> doc in the <a href="https://sprint.ly/">Sprint.ly</a> repo. It also allowed senior members of the team to stay focused, instead of context switching to help people.</p>

<p>Some other good things to document include: language style guides, office culture, <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/pull-request-templates-make-code-review-easier/">PR templates</a>, things to look for in PR review, QA tasks, and deploy steps.</p>

<h3>Docker</h3>

<p>We live in an exciting time. The dawn of containers has made it easier than ever to make sure that each person working on a project is working with the same system setup. I like to use <a href="https://www.docker.com/">Docker</a> to facilitate running applications across all environments, from development to CI to production. If you&rsquo;ve never created a container before, I recommend checking out my colleague Alex Johnson&rsquo;s <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/sailing-past-dependency-hell-with-docker-distributed-systems/">Sailing Past Dependency Hell With Docker</a>.</p>

<p>Docker isn&rsquo;t right for every team, but if you have the knowledge and time to get it set up, it can save hours of time that would otherwise be spent googling errors and entering arcane commands into SSH tunnels. I&rsquo;d recommend looking into it.</p>

<h2>Pay Off Technical Debt</h2>

<p>Great documentation is a good first step, but often it isn&rsquo;t enough to ramp up developers on code in a reasonable amount of time on its own. If your app has accrued significant amounts of technical debt, this can present a major milestone. There are two kinds of tech debt to look for: dependency debt and native debt. Here are some ways to pay down each.</p>

<h3>Dependency Debt</h3>

<p>If your app was built back in the heyday of <em>(name your tech stack here)</em>, you probably made use of a lot of open source packages that were popular and well-maintained at the time. But fast-forward a few years, and suddenly some of your dependencies are outdated, others deprecated. This can be not only frustrating, but also a potential security concern.</p>

<p>If this describes you, you&rsquo;ve probably missed some patches that deal with widely publicized security issues. This can be a concern for open source packages and languages alike. For example, if you&rsquo;re still running Ruby 2.1.1, you might find that you&rsquo;re vulnerable to DNS Hijack attacks and <a href="http://www.cvedetails.com/vulnerability-list/vendor_id-7252/product_id-12215/version_id-164073/Ruby-lang-Ruby-2.1.1.html">other security holes</a>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s safest to invest a couple of days getting your language and dependency versions updated <em>before</em> bringing on a bunch of new developers. Not only will this fix your security holes, it will save you tons of time in working out module version conflicts.</p>

<h4>Gems &amp; Modules</h4>

<p>If your app is built in Ruby or JavaScript, you&rsquo;re probably making use of <a href="http://bundler.io/">Bundler</a> or <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/">NPM</a> to resolve dependency versions and pull them down. In your <code>Gemfile</code> or <code>package.json</code>, you may be specifying the specific versions of packages you want to use, like this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="n">gem</span> <span class="s1">&#39;jquery-rails&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span>           <span class="s1">&#39;~&gt; 2.1.3&#39;</span>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Or this:</p>

<span class='line-number'>2</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Your new developers pull down the repo, run <code>bundle install</code> or <code>npm install</code>, and soon find out that you actually <em>can&rsquo;t</em> install some things on the latest version of OS X without passing special flags.</p>

<p>Or maybe you realize that the authentication gem you&rsquo;re using is one or two major versions behind the latest release. Fine, you think, and update the version specification. But then, when you try to run the install, you have version conflicts with another gem.</p>

<p>I have yet to find a good way to resolve all of these problems at once. The best approach I&rsquo;ve found is to start with the module that you most need to update. Bump its version, then try running the <code>install</code>. If there&rsquo;s a dependency version conflict, change that. Keep following this pattern until the waterfall of pain subsides. Then repeat the process with the next package that you know needs updating. If you run into issues, sometimes a <code>bundle update</code> or deleting the <code>node_modules</code> folder completely and reinstalling can get you closer to success.</p>

<h4>The Rails Upgrade By Version Trick</h4>

<p>When it comes to updating Ruby gems, I&rsquo;ve come across nothing more painful than updating <a href="http://rubyonrails.org/">Rails</a> across multiple versions. I&rsquo;ve recently been working on upgrading an old Rails 3.1 app to Rails 4.2 for a client. When I try updating the gem version all at once, I get so many regressions and new bugs that I don&rsquo;t even know where to start.</p>

<p>There is a better way. Begin by upgrading Rails one <em>minor</em> version at a time. So, if you&rsquo;re on 3.1, upgrade to 3.2 before attempting to go to 4.0. Then go on to 4.1 and 4.2. There&rsquo;s a <a href="https://rubygems.org/gems/rails/versions">list of Rails releases</a> you can use to drive this process. I&rsquo;ve also found this <a href="http://www.rails-upgrade-checklist.com/">Rails Upgrade Checklist</a> site pretty helpful. It lets you know all the deprecations you need to change for each version along the way.</p>

<h3>Native Debt</h3>

<p>So you&rsquo;ve got all of your dependencies updated, and installing your app is a breeze. You can get a new developer from zero to sixty in an hour. Great! But now, do they actually understand anything about what&rsquo;s going on in the code base?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re lucky, your last team wrote clear, understandable code with lots of comments and no duplication. In reality, the odds of that are pretty low. Because of customer demands and pressure on time and budget, every code base ends up with some cruft, duplication, and just plain cryptic parts.</p>

<p>Take the time before your new team rolls on to clean things up a little bit. It will be invaluable in getting them up and running, ready to be part of the conversation on architectural decisions. Here a couple of steps you can take to get there.</p>

<h4>Refactor</h4>

<p>You&rsquo;ve heard it before: if you practice agile development, you need to refactor. It&rsquo;s something you should be doing along the way if you&rsquo;re practicing Test Driven Development. The mantra goes: <code>red, green, REFACTOR</code>. Nevertheless, there are probably dozens of places that your code could benefit from some refactoring.</p>

<p>If your team is new to refactoring, I highly recommend the <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoring.html">Refactoring book</a> or its <a href="http://martinfowler.com/books/refactoringRubyEd.html">Ruby counterpart</a>. You don&rsquo;t have to become refactoring experts, just pick up a couple of patterns and go to town. Most of the time, there is some kind of smell that&rsquo;s repeated throughout the codebase. If you learn to identify it, it becomes easy to identify and snipe.</p>

<p>Generally speaking, I&rsquo;ve found that the easiest wins are to <code>extract</code> and <code>inline</code> code. This works at any level of scope. If you have a big, unweildy method that&rsquo;s doing a lot, you can <a href="http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2014/01/10/refactoring-1-extract-method/">extract a method</a> from it. If you have a class calling a method that doesn&rsquo;t make any sense, you might want to <a href="http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2014/01/17/refactoring-2-replace-method-with-method-object/">extract an object</a>. You can also go the other way: if there&rsquo;s some unnecessary indirection, you can pull code right into the class or method that needs it.</p>

<p>Spending a day or two refactoring the hairiest parts of you application can make things  understandability. That makes a big difference in your team&rsquo;s  efficiency.</p>

<h4>Delete Dead Code</h4>

<p>Related to refactoring, another great way to reduce the mental overhead involved in starting with a new app is to remove dead code.</p>

<p>One easy win is to &ldquo;snipe&rdquo; unused dependencies. You should also look through the codebase and remove any functions or methods that are old and not being used anymore. It can be hard to determine where exactly those spots are. If you have someone who&rsquo;s familiar with the code, asking them can be a good place to start.</p>

<p>My colleague <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/author/mgayhart/">Meeka Gayhart</a> also suggests cleaning up cruft by looking for all the places where a package or method is called, and removing it if there aren&rsquo;t any callers in the current code. You can also look through git history to confirm using the <a href="http://www.philandstuff.com/2014/02/09/git-pickaxe.html">git pickaxe</a>.</p>

<p>If you have a good test suite, make sure to run it often as you remove suspect bits of code to make sure nothing broke.</p>

<p>Take the time to clean up your code base before new developers roll on, it can save huge amounts of time. New devs don&rsquo;t have to work as hard to understand what&rsquo;s going on, so they can spend those mental cycles shipping new features instead.</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>In this post, we looked at a couple of strategies for getting a new team ready to develop on an old code base. We looked at how to streamline the technical set up process, some tips for updating dependencies, and ways to pay down technical debt.</p>

<p>There are few things more exciting to a major stakeholder in an application than seeing it rise from the ashes to conquer the world a second time. I hope these tips help get you back to the glory days! Stay tuned for part two of this series, where we&rsquo;ll take a look at some higher-level planning ideas that can help ensure you make the most of your development time from here.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/testing-flux-applications/">The Quick Left Blog</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>A lot of people in the JavaScript community are pretty excited about Facebook&rsquo;s <a href="http://facebook.github.io/react/">React</a> library, and associated <a href="http://facebook.github.io/flux/">Flux</a> architecture. We&rsquo;ve been using quite a bit of these tools in our client-side projects at Quick Left. It can be a little hard to wrap your mind around the way the data flows at first, but once you get used to it, you come to appreciate how clean it can be.</p>

<p>As with any development, test-driving features is the way to go in a Flux app. As I&rsquo;ve been learning this technology, I&rsquo;ve been collecting some of the less obvious patterns that make testing easier. In this post, we&rsquo;ll take a look at some of these strategies, to make it easier for you to build the next big thing.</p>

<h2>Setup</h2>

<h3>Project Structure</h3>

<p>Since Flux is a more of an idea than a framework, there&rsquo;s no convention as to how to structure your project. I personally like to break it down in a fairly obvious fashion, with the different Flux objects grouped together by folder.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app/
</span><span class='line'>├── actions
</span><span class='line'>├── collections
</span><span class='line'>├── dispatchers
</span><span class='line'>├── lib
</span><span class='line'>├── models
</span><span class='line'>├── stores
</span><span class='line'>└── views</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There are a couple of places to put the tests, but I&rsquo;ve been leaning toward a pattern where the tests live right alongside their corresponding files. This makes it easy to find the test for a given module. It also keeps the directory structures from getting out of sync, as they might if you put everything into a separate <code>test/</code> folder. Here&rsquo;s an example of what this might look like.</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
<span class='line-number'>12</span>
<span class='line-number'>13</span>
<span class='line-number'>14</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>app/
</span><span class='line'>├── actions
</span><span class='line'>|   |── user-actions.js
</span><span class='line'>|   |── user-actions-test.js
</span><span class='line'>├── collections
</span><span class='line'>├── dispatchers
</span><span class='line'>├── lib
</span><span class='line'>├── models
</span><span class='line'>├── stores
</span><span class='line'>|   |── users-store.js
</span><span class='line'>|   |── users-store-test.js
</span><span class='line'>└── views
</span><span class='line'>    |── login.js
</span><span class='line'>    |── login-test.js</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When we find the files to run in our test suite, we can just use <a href="https://www.npmjs.com/package/glob">globbing</a> to find them all, so it doesn&rsquo;t really present any problems for setting up our tests.</p>

<h3>Testing Dependencies</h3>

<p>Facebook recommends using their testing tool, <a href="https://facebook.github.io/jest/">Jest</a>, to test React and Flux components. Although I totally respect Jest, <a href="https://github.com/facebook/jest/issues/139">it doesn&rsquo;t run in the browser</a>, plus I&rsquo;m pretty used to the toolchain I&rsquo;m about to describe, so I go about things a slightly different way.</p>

<h4>Mocha + Chai</h4>

<p>When it comes to testing frameworks, I&rsquo;m a big fan of <a href="http://mochajs.org/">Mocha</a>. It gives us <code>describe</code> and all of the other <a href="">BDD-style</a> assertions we could want when combined with <a href="http://chaijs.com/">ChaiJS</a>.</p>

<h4>Sinon</h4>

<p>Since there are a lot of dependencies in a Flux app, we&rsquo;ll probably be doing a lot of stubbing. I like to use <a href="">SinonJS</a> for this purpose. It gives us stubs and spies, and its API provides the ability to drill down into how functions were called and with what arguments with a level of granularity that can come in really useful.</p>

<h4>Karma</h4>

<p>When it comes to test runners, there are many viable choices. Lately, I&rsquo;ve been leaning toward <a href="">Karma</a> for most of my needs, because it&rsquo;s easy to get set up, and it can be hooked into a coverage tool with ease.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s an example <code>karma.conf</code> file for a Flux app in ES6 with <a href="">Browserify</a> and <a href="">Babel</a>.</p>

<h4>Coverage</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interesting in setting up a coverage tool to see how well-tested your code base is, check out my post <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/measuring-clientside-javascript-test-coverage-istanbul/">Measuring Clientside JavaScript Test Coverage With Istanbul</a>.</p>

<h4>NPM Build Scripts</h4>

<p>As far as running tasks, you can rely on Grunt or Gulp, or you can just set a test script up in your <code>package.json</code> file. Doing it this way, running tests is as simple as typing <code>npm test</code>. Here&rsquo;s what to put into <code>package.json</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='json'><span class='line'><span class="s2">&quot;scripts&quot;</span><span class="err">:</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nt">&quot;test&quot;</span><span class="p">:</span> <span class="s2">&quot;NODE_ENV=test ./node_modules/karma/bin/karma start&quot;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>With these dependencies set up, you&rsquo;re all ready to start writing tests. Let&rsquo;s take a look at some of the testing specifics.</p>

<h2>Actually Writing Tests</h2>

<p>There are four parts to a Flux app: <code>Actions</code>, <code>Stores</code>, <code>Views</code>, and <code>Dispatchers</code>.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, Flux is more of a pattern than a framework. Although several people have released experimental frameworks built in its image, there is only one official Facebook package, called <code>flux</code>. Ironically, it only contains a <code>Dispatcher</code>. You can find the source code <a href="https://github.com/facebook/flux">here</a>. Since this package works well and is tested externally, so we won&rsquo;t be looking at testing <code>Dispatchers</code> in this post.</p>

<p>Before we get into looking at the remaining parts of Flux in depth, here are a couple of tips that come in handy in all cases.</p>

<h3>Any Object</h3>

<h4>Setting Up A Sandbox</h4>

<p>Sinon sandboxes are a great way to use stubs and spies without having to restore the objects they&rsquo;re touching later. You can clean things up automatically by setting up a new sandbox before each test and tearing it down afterwards.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">beforeEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">afterEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sinon</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">restore</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h4>Getting Dependencies</h4>

<p>Sometimes it can be a pain to pull in and/or stub a bunch of dependencies for an object you&rsquo;re testing. There&rsquo;s an easy way to grab what you need from within the test: using <a href="https://github.com/jhnns/rewire">Rewire</a>, which exposes a special <code>__get__</code> method you can use to access whatever you need from the top level scope of the module. You can then stub out methods and properties on those modules. Here&rsquo;s how to leverage it to your advantage.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
<span class='line-number'>8</span>
<span class='line-number'>9</span>
<span class='line-number'>10</span>
<span class='line-number'>11</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">beforeEach</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sinon</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">sinon</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sandbox</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">create</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todos</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">MyAction</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">__get__</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;todos&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nx">describe</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;something related to todos&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">it</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="s1">&#39;doesnt have to care about todos&#39;</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">sinon</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">stub</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">todos</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;getAll&#39;</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="c1">// do something else that calls this.todos.getAll without worrying about the result</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">});</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As a note, you don&rsquo;t even need to use Rewire unless you need access to instance variables on your objects. Since Flux uses plain objects, multiple calls to <code>require</code> will always return the same object. This means that you can just spy on or stub out a method on one of your <code>Actions</code> or <code>Stores</code> directly after requiring them.</p>

<h3>Actions</h3>

<h4>Testing Event Dispatching</h4>

<p>When you&rsquo;re writing a Flux action, it typically sends some kind of event and payload to the <code>AppDispatcher</code> to trigger events registered elsewhere in the application. It&rsquo;s easy to spy on the <code>AppDispatcher</code> and test that it&rsquo;s called with the right arguments to ensure that your <code>Action</code> is working properly.</p>

<h4>Testing Promises</h4>

<p>We often load data from a remote server in our <code>Action</code> objects, so there are typically a lot of promises involved in its internals. When testing these methods, it&rsquo;s often useful to stub out these promises. It&rsquo;s pretty easy to do using native promises in ES6. Note that we use <code>setTimeout</code> and <code>done</code> to ensure that the promise is fully resolved before testing our assertion and moving on to the next test.</p>

<h3>Stores</h3>

<p>In my own Flux projects, I have tried to keep the external API of <code>stores</code> as &ldquo;dumb&rdquo; as possible. They are meant to be simple repositories for business objects that expose an interface for other objects to subscribe to change events. I typically define methods named <code>emitChange</code>, <code>addChangeListener</code>, and <code>removeEventListener</code> for each store.</p>

<p>Despite their relatively simple API, it is vitally important to test your <code>stores</code>. They&rsquo;re usually the place where the business logic lives. Plus, they&rsquo;re responsible for loading data from the server into the client-side app. For these reasons, we want to make sure they work properly. Here are a couple of tricks that can be helpful.</p>

<h4>Using Internals</h4>

<p>Given that <code>stores</code> are only supposed to accept data through the callback they register with the <code>dispatcher</code>, it can be tricky to send mocked data into them while testing. Facebook has one suggested way of doing it <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/blog/2014/09/24/testing-flux-applications.html#testing-stores">with Jest</a>, or you can try <a href="http://bensmithett.com/testing-flux-stores-without-jest/">this approach</a> with Mocha or Jasmine. Alternatively, another nice way to hide the implementation a store uses to fetch its data is to wrap the fetch implementation in an <code>internals</code> object and test that instead. Here&rsquo;s what it looks like:</p>

<h4>Using Dependency Injection</h4>

<p>If you write your <code>stores</code> in an object-oriented way, you can pass a reference to the <code>dispatcher</code> directly into them. This makes it easier to test that different dispatching events trigger the correct callbacks to produce the behavior that is desired. Here&rsquo;s an example (thanks to <a href="http://jaysoo.ca/2015/03/09/on-flux-stores-and-actions/">Jack Hsu</a> for the inspiration for this tip).</p>

<p>And now testing the store is simple. We can just inject a dispatcher and use it to trigger the events we want to test.</p>

<h3>View Components</h3>

<p>Finally we come to the view layer. If you&rsquo;ve played with React, writing these view components should come naturally.</p>

<p>When it comes to testing, there are a lot of things you can safely skip, since testing them would just be verifying that React works as expected. For example, checking that <code>onClick</code> handlers fire is pointless, since we know that React will call them. On the other hand, it can be useful that the behavior we want them to cause is actually carried out.</p>

<h4>Wrap Components With StubRouterContext</h4>

<p>It&rsquo;s usually a good idea to wrap your components in a stubbed out context, to make it easier to force them to behave the way you want within your tests. If you don&rsquo;t, it can be hard to get them to render and behave as expected.</p>

<p>To get this to happen, I recommend using the <a href="https://gist.github.com/cmain/69aee0b5d9cab96589d7">stub-router-context</a> module from the <a href="https://github.com/rackt/react-router">react-router project</a>. It&rsquo;s useful for wrapping the context of all kinds of components aside from the React Router. Although I tend to stick to the name &ldquo;Stub Router Context&rdquo;, it would perhaps be more accurate to just call it &ldquo;stub context&rdquo;, since you can use it to stub out any context.</p>

<p>I also like to add a ref to the stub in the component that&rsquo;s returned in <code>render</code>, to make it easier to get hold of the component being wrapped by the component returned by <code>stub-router-context</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Here&rsquo;s how it looks when you include it in your test. Note how the ref I included makes it easy to grab the child and call <code>setState</code> on it.</p>

<h4>Use the React TestUtils</h4>

<p>When it comes to rendering your component into a test DOM, checking whether classes are being dynamically added or removed, or whether input values are are changing in response to user interactions, the React TestUtils can&rsquo;t be beat. Get to know <a href="https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/test-utils.html">the TestUtils API</a>, and use it to test your view components. It makes things much less painful.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>Committing to a test-driven development approach in client-side JavaScript applications can sometimes be a hard sell. Aside from problems with testing DOM manipulation and asynchronous code, it can also be hard to test patterns that are new to the team, like Flux. But with the right tools, it can become second nature to test some of these things. Once your team has the confidence that they can effectively test these components, it&rsquo;s a lot easier to approach all feature development with a TDD mindset.</p>

<p>In this post, we explored how to better test Flux applications. We took a look at some of the JS testing tools that can be helpful to get setup in your build process. We talked about some testing tips that are useful across all of the different Flux objects. Then we drilled down into testing tips specific to <code>Actions</code>, <code>Stores</code>, and <code>View Components</code>.</p>

<p>I hope that some of these tips come in useful for your team as you build your cutting-edge web application. Best of luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="http://deis.com/blog/2015/how-deployed-my-first-app-to-deis">The Deis Blog</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>Have you ever felt the pain that comes when your app runs fine on development, but breaks terribly in production? Maybe your CI build has been red for days, but you haven&rsquo;t had time to figure out how the CI server is misconfigured?</p>

<p>With containers, you can easily rid yourself of such dependency woes. If the app runs in a container on one machine, it will most likely run in the same container on another.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve bought into a container-based development workflow, the question soon arises: how can I get my production server to run my application in a container without the difficulty of having to provision a bare server with all of the other services, writing deploy tasks, and handling scaling issues on my own? In short, can I have a managed production environment that also supports containers?</p>

<p>The answer is yes. Using <a href="http://deis.io/">Deis</a>, an open source Platform as a Service, you can host and manage your Docker-based application using your own Amazon Web Services (AWS) servers, without the hassle of configuring a bare Linux server.</p>

<p>I recently deployed a simple Rails app to Deis, and took notes along the way. In this post, I&rsquo;ll share the steps I took to set up a <a href="https://try.deis.com/">Deis Pro</a> account and deploy a new application.</p>

<h2>Setting Up AWS</h2>

<p>Deis applications run on a cluster of servers tied to your AWS account. This allows you to control your settings with Amazon, and takes the middle man out of the billing process for server resources. Since I didn&rsquo;t have an AWS account, I had to create one. To do this, I followed <a href="https://support.cloud.engineyard.com/hc/en-us/articles/205501008-Before-You-Begin-Set-Up-Your-AWS-Account-and-User">this guide from Engine Yard</a>. Here&rsquo;s a quick run down of what I did.</p>

<p>First, I visisted <a href="http://aws.amazon.com">aws.amazon.com</a> and clicked on &ldquo;Create a Free Account&rdquo;. I walked through the signup process, entering my credentials and credit card information.</p>

<p>Once my account was all set up and I was logged in, I visited the &ldquo;Identity &amp; Access Management&rdquo; page, then clicked &ldquo;Groups&rdquo; on the sidebar. I then created a group called &ldquo;DeisAdminGroup&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Next, I created a user called &ldquo;deis_user&rdquo; under the &ldquo;Users&rdquo; tab. When I created it, Amazon asked me to download the user credentials in a CSV file, which I saved. Finally, I went back to &ldquo;Groups&rdquo;, selected my group, clicked &ldquo;Add Users to Group&rdquo;, and added &ldquo;deis_user&rdquo; to the group.</p>

<p>With these steps completed, I had my AWS user and security group set up. Next I turned my attention to setting up a Deis Pro account.</p>

<h2>Signing Up For Deis PRO</h2>

<p>Before I could deploy my app to Deis Pro, I had to <a href="https://try.deis.com/">sign up for an account</a>.</p>

<p>I filled out the form, and a few minutes later I got a verification email. I clicked the link in the email, then entered my billing information. Deis then asked for my AWS credentials. I entered the information saved in the CSV I downloaded when I was setting up AWS, and I was ready to go.</p>

<h2>Creating the Cluster</h2>

<p>Now that I was signed in to my Deis PRO account, I began to set up some server resources that I could deploy my application to. Here are the steps I followed to get them ready.</p>

<p>First, I visited my dashboard and clicked &ldquo;Create Environment&rdquo;. Since I didn&rsquo;t need any special performance resources or customizations, I just used the default options for server size and memory allocations. I created an administrator username and password.</p>

<p>Next, I created three servers on AWS using the Deis PRO UI as part of the &ldquo;create environment&rdquo; process. For me, this process failed the first time, but when I tried again, the servers eventually came online. The last thing before leaving the Deis PRO site was to make note of my Deis endpoint name (it looks like deis.1ab2345.my.ey.io) so that I could use it to configure my app from the command line.</p>

<h2>Installing Deis Locally</h2>

<p>After setting up my AWS and Deis accounts, I turned my attention to getting the <a href="http://docs.deis.io/en/latest/using_deis/install-client/">Deis command line client</a> installed on my development machine. It was as simple as running this <code>curl</code> command:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>curl -sSL http://deis.io/deis-cli/install.sh | sh -s 1.7.3</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>From there, I needed to put the <code>deis</code> executable into my <code>$PATH</code>. Although I could have used a symlink, I opted to move it directly to <code>usr/local/bin</code> with <code>mv deis /usr/local/bin/deis</code> instead. After running these two commands, I was able to run <code>deis -h</code>.</p>

<p>As a last step before setting up an app, I also needed to login to the server cluster I&rsquo;d created and add the SSH key from my local machine to it. I logged into my Deis endpoint using <code>deis login deis.1ab2345.my.ey.io</code>. The endpoint name was the one I got from the Deis Pro website when I was setting up my resources. I found the username and password for the cluster in the Deis PRO UI. After I logged in, I added my local SSH key with <code>deis keys:add</code>.</p>

<p>With the Deis CLI set up and connected to my server cluster, I was ready to begin deploying my application.</p>

<h2>Deploying The App</h2>

<p>When I was finishing bootcamp, I wrote an application called <a href="https://github.com/fluxusfrequency/12stepper">Twelve Stepper</a> to help 12 Step Program participants interact with friends, find meetings, and work with the steps. Since it&rsquo;s a fairly simple application, I thought it would be a good one to use for my first Deis deploy.</p>

<p>I cloned it down from GitHub, bundled my gems and ran migrations as I would for any other Rails project. I also made a <code>Dockerfile</code> and got the app running in a container locally. Then I set up a Deis project by running <code>deis create 12stepper</code> from within the project folder.</p>

<p>After that, I tried to deploy using <code>git push deis master</code>, but I ran into an error: <code>tar: invalid tar magic</code>. After doing a little research, I found that I had forgotten to include a <code>Procfile</code>, so I created one. After adding it to <code>git</code> and pushing again, my app successfully deployed.</p>

<p>I ran <code>deis open</code>, and there was my app, up and running on the web!</p>

<h2>Wrapping Up</h2>

<p>Getting Twelve Stepper set up on a Deis PRO cluster was pretty easy, all told. Most of my time was spent setting up accounts on AWS and Deis PRO and installing the Deis CLI. But these were one-time tasks. From here on out, deploying apps to Deis will be as easy as creating a new server cluster from my Deis PRO dashboard, then running <code>deis create &lt;appname&gt;</code> and <code>git push deis master</code> from my project folder.</p>

<p>I was surprised how easy it was to get my app up and running on a managed production environment using a container with Deis. If you&rsquo;re using a container-based development environment, I would definitely recommend checking Deis out as a hosting and deployment solution. Good luck!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/goodbye-minimum-viable-product-hello-v1">Engine Yard</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>You&rsquo;ve done it! It all started with an idea and two people in your garage. After weeks of coding and tweaking, you&rsquo;ve proven that your business idea is the greatest thing since sliced bread. You used <a href="http://steveblank.com/2015/05/06/build-measure-learn-throw-things-against-the-wall-and-see-if-they-work/">the Build, Measure, Learn cycle</a> to find out what your customers want, and you&rsquo;re pretty sure you have a product market fit.</p>

<p>Now what?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s time to build your V1. In the post, we&rsquo;ll look at how to take the most important lessons from the information you&rsquo;ve gleaned during the MVP stage of your product&rsquo;s lifecycle and apply them to building the first full release of your product.</p>

<h2>V0: Minimum Viable Product</h2>

<p>If you&rsquo;re interested in building the V1 of your project, you&rsquo;ve probably already spent a good amount of time iterating on features, measuring customer feedback, and learning more about what the market wants in your problem space. If you haven&rsquo;t started building an MVP, or are still working on it, check out <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/actually-mvp">my thoughts on MVP</a> and come back to this article when you think you&rsquo;re sure that your product is ready to be scaled.</p>

<p>If you <em>have</em> been using an MVP process, and you feel that you&rsquo;ve validated your assumptions, that people would like to use and pay for your product, you&rsquo;re probably ready to start thinking about building your V1. It&rsquo;s time to take all of the metrics and feedback you&rsquo;ve been gathering and put it together to make the first <em>complete</em> version of your product.</p>

<p>Before we continue, make sure you&rsquo;ve answered these questions. What are your target demographic and platform? Which features make up the core of your offering? Which have resulted in the most clicks and positive feedback?</p>

<p>With all of these things in hand, let&rsquo;s turn our attention to what it takes to release a V1.</p>

<h2>V1: The Final Frontier</h2>

<p>If you think about it, V1 is kind of a funny concept. If you&rsquo;ve been releasing MVP features for a while, you probably already have a functioning product. It might even be <em>complete</em>, in the sense that customers use it and pay for it, and aren&rsquo;t missing anything that they need to releave their pain points.</p>

<p>Yet it&rsquo;s definitely possible to draw a line in the sand between <em>beta</em> and <em>V1</em>. According to Wikipedia&rsquo;s definition of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Software_versioning">Software Versioning</a>, the free-software community tends to define 1.0 as a &ldquo;major milestone, indicating that the software is &lsquo;complete&rsquo;, that it has all major features, and is considered reliable enough for general release&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Of course, we know better. After releasing a piece software, there will always changes big and small: security concerns corrected, features added, previously undiscovered instabilities fixed. To plan all of our features, set a date, and keep everything shrouded in secrecy until then is a hopelessly waterfall-esque approach that leads to a far more costly product.</p>

<p>In many ways, the distinction between beta and V1 is largely a marketing concern. As you iterate on an MVP, those brave souls known as <a href="">early adopters</a> are by your side, helping light the way. But once you tell the world that what you&rsquo;re offering is now a &ldquo;real&rdquo; product, you begin to see what the less brave among us are willing to buy. You&rsquo;ve potentially expanded your market greatly, by giving birth to &ldquo;The New (your product name here)&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Do you think your product has what it takes to convert this new audience to your cause? As my friend and colleague <a href="http://justinjackson.ca/">Justin Jackson</a> puts it, &ldquo;the real question is: can you profitably acquire new customers every month?&rdquo; MVP should show that you have some initial traction. V1 should show that you actually have a business.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s take a look at some strategies you can use to make your transition from MVP to V1 a successful one.</p>

<h4>Build A Roadmap</h4>

<p>Before you start writing stories for the big release, pause for a second and question your assumptions. You might be excited, because you think you&rsquo;ve got a handle on what your customers want, and you&rsquo;re ready to give it to them as soon as you can!</p>

<p>Stop. Take a breath. Think. How does what you&rsquo;re about to build fit in with the plans you have for your <em>business</em>?</p>

<p>If you don&rsquo;t have a roadmap, you should make one as soon as possible. It doesn&rsquo;t have to be an all-day exercise, but you should be able to answer some basic questions.</p>

<p>Do you know <em>which</em> features you&rsquo;re going to build? What about funding? If you don&rsquo;t have investors, does what you&rsquo;re about to build have the ability to attract them? If you do, are there certain things they&rsquo;re hoping you will build? Do you have a plan for scaling your development team? What about marketing? If all else fails, do you know how to pivot?</p>

<h3>Set A Deadline</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s tempting to think of V1 as the chance to sit back, take your time, and do the waterfall thing. You&rsquo;ve moved fast and broken things to prove that you have a market fit, and now you can spend as long as you need to build the first stable version. That&rsquo;s a mistake. Getting to V1 is just a high-pressure as finding an MVP that proves its value.</p>

<p>You might have an initial MVP that&rsquo;s proven it has traction, put your head down for eight months to build V1, and by the time you release it, find out that you&rsquo;ve made a big mistake. Maybe the features you focused on building out turned out to be ones that customers wanted &ndash; it&rsquo;s just that they weren&rsquo;t willing to <em>pay</em> for them. Maybe another company beat you to market. Maybe you overlooked a key integration with another service that would have allowed you to <em>take off</em>. These are the kind of mistakes that you can&rsquo;t afford to make as a business.</p>

<p>Taking too long to get to V1 is just as bad as taking too long to build MVP. Make sure that you know where you&rsquo;re headed and when you&rsquo;ll get there.</p>

<h4>Identify Your Target Market</h4>

<p>If you&rsquo;re about to outgrow your MVP, you probably think you know your target market. But take a closer look. Your excitement <em>could</em> by hiding some assumptions. Can you get more granular about the different subdivisions that make up your user base, and use that information to find out more about who you&rsquo;re targeting?</p>

<p>Have you figured out <em>which</em> customers you should be listening to? Hint: <em>it&rsquo;s the ones that would actually</em> pay <em>for your service</em>. When you were building an MVP, you proved that you could find paying customers. In V1, you want to prove that you can <em>consistently</em> pick up new customers that will pay you more than it costs you to provide your service to them.</p>

<p><a href="http://justinjackson.ca/ultimate-validation/">Justin Jackson</a> weighs in again: &ldquo;To be successful, a product needs customers that are easy to reach, cheap to convert, and undemanding to support&rdquo;.</p>

<p>To dig deeper into these questions, I highly recommend going through a <a href="https://quickleft.com/packages/ux-design/">User Experience (UX) discovery process</a>. You should create <a href="http://www.usability.gov/how-to-and-tools/methods/personas.html">personas</a> and think about the emotional response that you are hoping to evoke. UX discovery can help answer important questions, like: &ldquo;should we move to mobile?&rdquo; and &ldquo;what are our key features?&rdquo;</p>

<h4>Identify Your Key Features And Cut The Rest</h4>

<p>A huge part of the MVP process is measuring customer engagement with the different features you&rsquo;re testing. Pull out all of our customer interviews and surveys. Read through the reports in your analytics software. Make a list of all the features that you&rsquo;ve had success with, and rank them. Which ones were the most popular?</p>

<p>Your V1 should focus on your core features <em>only</em>. Cut the rest. Remember, for each feature you add, you have to think not only about the feature, but also tests, regressions, and bugs. <em>Plus</em>, you&rsquo;ll be dealing with scaling your business. Employees, culture, and performance are going to be concerns in a way that they weren&rsquo;t during the MVP process. Keep it simple.</p>

<h3>Build A Strong Cultural Foundation</h3>

<p>The business you build when you&rsquo;re going to V1 sets stage for everything that will come after. Now is the time to think about what kind of company you want to create. You will want to make decisions that build a strong foundation for what&rsquo;s to come.</p>

<p>You will be hiring new developers. The culture you inspire and the process you set up for five developers are the blueprints that will be followed when you get to fifty. The process you use to acquire new customers had better be scalable, or you could find your pipeline going dry a few months down the road.</p>

<p>Take the time to think through what kind of place you would like to work in, and try to manifest that reality as you build your V1.</p>

<h3>Build A Strong Technical Foundation</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;ve done a good job of building MVP features at a minimal cost, you probably already have some technical debt that needs to be paid down. This is the time to switch out stopgap measures for a scalable tech stack.</p>

<p>Maybe you proved your concept with a simple WordPress site, an email list, or one of the other simple MVP approaches I discussed in <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/actually-mvp">my MVP article</a>. These are all great ways to get started, but they&rsquo;re not very customizable. If you&rsquo;re stuck with the features that you get with a certain WordPress plugin, you might find yourself unable to extend or change your features in a timely and stable manner down the road. Plus, moving away from plugins often cuts out the middleman and allows you to recover some capital that you were spending on things you can provide in-house.</p>

<p>Take the time to consider what kind of tech stack will meet your needs. Take the time to understand the tradeoffs between different technologies in the market, and find the ones that best meet your business&rsquo;s needs. It can be useful to do a <a href="https://quickleft.com/packages/discovery-sprint/">discovery sprint</a> to find out what options are available to you.</p>

<p>Find ways to ensure that your code remains working and stable. I highly recommend following a <a href="https://quickleft.com/blog/how-to-write-tests-first/">Test-Driven Development process</a>, writing functional tests, signing up for <a href="https://codeclimate.com/">Code Climate</a>, setting up a continuous integration service like <a href="http://wercker.com/">Wercker</a>, <a href="https://travis-ci.org/">TravisCI</a>, or <a href="https://circleci.com/">CircleCI</a>, and deploying to a staging server before releasing things to production. These safeguards will protect you and your team from accidentally breaking your application, and be the canary in the coal mine to let you know when things are about to go wrong.</p>

<p>Finally, make sure you&rsquo;re thinking about scale. If you&rsquo;re hoping to get tons of new users you&rsquo;ll want to have infrastructure in place that will allow you to serve a heavy load of users. If you&rsquo;re using <a href="https://www.engineyard.com">Engine Yard</a>, it&rsquo;s easy to upgrade your servers from your dashboard with a few clicks, plus they&rsquo;re always monitoring your app for emerging issues, and their support team is immediately available to support you as you respond to a high volume of requests.</p>

<p>As you start building your first release, make sure that you&rsquo;re investing in technologies that will support your business as it grows.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The move from MVP to V1 is a moment of transition for your business. It&rsquo;s vital to consider the norms that you&rsquo;re about to set up, which will have far-reaching effects into the future. You have to be smart. Know your customers, know your features, and don&rsquo;t delay. But also build a strong foundation, culturally and technically. Finally, set a deadline and stick to it. This lets you build the buzz, keep your team focused, and provides a great excuse to throw a big party. Just don&rsquo;t forget to invite me!</p>

<p>Until then, best of luck with your business.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/smooth-transition-ecmascript-6-new-features">Engine Yard</a></p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/smooth-transition-ecmascript-6-integration">part one of this miniseries</a>, we talked about the timeline for ES6 rollout, feature compatibility in existing environments and transpilers, and how to get ES6 set up in your build process.</p>

<p>Today, we’ll continue the conversation, looking at some of the easiest places to start using ES6 in a typical front-end <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/integrating-react-with-backbone">Backbone + React</a> project. Even if that&rsquo;s not your stack, read on! There&rsquo;s something for everyone here.</p>

<p>If you want to try out the examples, you can use a sandboxed ES6 environment at <a href="http://www.es6fiddle.net/">ES6 Fiddle</a>.</p>

<h2>New Features</h2>

<h3>Classes, Shorthand Methods, and Shorthand Properties</h3>

<p>A lot of client-side JS code is object-oriented. If you&rsquo;re <a href="http://mikefowler.me/2014/06/11/backbone-with-es6/">using Backbone</a>, just about every Model, Collection, View, or Router you ever write will be a subclass of a core library Class. With ES6, extending these objects is a breeze. We can just call <code>class MySubclass extends MyClass</code> and we get object inheritance. We get access to a <code>constructor</code> method, and we can call <code>super</code> from within any method to apply the parent class&rsquo;s method of the same name. This prevents us from having to write things like:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">Backbone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">Collection</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">prototype</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">initialize</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">apply</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="k">this</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="nx">arguments</span><span class="p">)</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We also get some handy shorthands for defining methods and properties. Note the pattern I&rsquo;m using to call <code>initialize</code> instead of <code>initialize: function(args) {}</code>:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kr">class</span> <span class="nx">UserView</span> <span class="kr">extends</span> <span class="nx">Backbone</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">View</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">initialize</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">)</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    <span class="kr">super</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="nx">options</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>We can also define properties using a nice new shorthand. The code below sets an <code>app</code> property on the <code>Injector</code> that points to the instance of <code>App</code> we create on the second line. In other words, it&rsquo;s the same as doing <code>this.app = app;</code>.</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">App</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="kd">function</span><span class="p">()</span> <span class="p">{};</span> <span class="c1">// we&#39;ll look at &#39;let&#39; in just a second.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">app</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="k">new</span> <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">();</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="kd">let</span> <span class="nx">Injector</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="p">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="nx">app</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">};</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Let</h3>

<p>The new <code>let</code> keyword is probably the easiest win that you can possibly get in using ES6. If you do nothing else, just start replacing <code>var</code> with <code>let</code> everywhere. What&rsquo;s the difference, you ask? Well, <code>var</code> is scoped to the closest enclosing <em>function</em>, while <code>let</code> is scoped to the closest enclosing <em>block</em>.</p>

<p>In essence, variables defined with <code>let</code> aren&rsquo;t visible outside of <code>if</code> blocks and <code>for</code> loops, so there&rsquo;s less likelihood for a naming collision. There are other benefits. See <a href="http://stackoverflow.com/questions/762011/javascript-let-keyword-vs-var-keyword">this Stack Overflow answer</a> for more details.</p>

<p>You can use it pretty much everywhere, but here&rsquo;s a good example of somewhere that it actually makes a difference in preventing a naming collision. The <code>userName</code>s inside of the <code>for</code> loop don&rsquo;t clash with the current user&rsquo;s <code>userName</code> defined just above it.</p>

</span><span class='line'><span class="p">});</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<h3>Const</h3>

<p>As you might guess from the name, <code>const</code> defines a read-only (constant) variable. It should be pretty easy to guess where to use this. For example:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>

<h3>The Fat Arrow</h3>

<p>You&rsquo;ve probably already heard about the fat arrow, or used it before if you&rsquo;ve written any CoffeeScript. The fat arrow, <code>=&gt;</code>, is a new way to define a function. It preserves the value of <code>this</code> from the surrounding context, so you don&rsquo;t have to use workarounds like <code>var self = this;</code> or <code>bind</code>. It comes in really handy when dealing with nested functions. Plus it looks really cool.</p>

<h3>Template Strings</h3>

<h3>String Sugar</h3>

<p>It&rsquo;s always been kind of a pain to check for substrings in JavaScript. <code>if (myString.indexOf(mySubstring) !== -1)</code>? Give me a break! ES6 finally gives us some sugar to make this a little easier. We can call <code>startsWith</code>, <code>endsWith</code>, <code>includes</code>, and <code>repeat</code>.</p>

<h3>Argument Defaults</h3>

<p>Languages like Ruby and Python have long allowed you to define argument defaults in your method and function signatures. With the addition of this feature to ES6, writing Backbone views requires one less line of boilerplate.</p>

<p>By setting options to an argument default, we don&rsquo;t have to worry about cases where nothing is passed in. No more <code>options = options || {};</code> statements!</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>

<h3>Spread and Rest</h3>

<p>Sometimes function calls that take multiple arguments can get really messy to deal with. Like when you&rsquo;re calling them from a <code>bind</code> that&rsquo;s being triggered by an event listener.</p>

<p>For example, check out this event listener from a Backbone view in a recent project I was working on. Because of the method signature of <code>_resizeProductBox</code>, I have to pass all those null arguments into <code>bind</code> and it gets kind of ugly.</p>

<p>In ES6, we can clean this up a bit with <em>spread</em>. We&rsquo;ll just prepend an array of default arguments with a <code>...</code>  to send them through as arguments to the method call.</p>

<p>On the other side of the coin is <em>rest</em>, which lets us accept any number of arguments in a method signature instead of at invocation time, as you can do with the <em>splat</em> in Ruby. For example:</p>

<h3>Array Destructuring</h3>

<p>Sometimes I find myself having to access all of the elements of an array-like object with square brackets. It&rsquo;s kind of a bummer. Luckily, ES6 lets me use array destructuring instead. It makes it easy to do things like splitting latitude and longitude from an array into two variables, as I do here. (Note that I also could have used <em>spread</em>.)</p>

<h3>Promises</h3>

<p>It seems like every project I work on these days uses promises. Native promises have landed in ES6, so we can all rely on the same API from here on out. Both promise instances and static methods like <code>Promise.all</code> are provided. Here&rsquo;s an example of a <code>userService</code> from an Angular app that returns a promise from <code>$http</code> if the user is online, and a native promise otherwise.</p>

<h2>A Note On Modules</h2>

<p>You may have noticed that I didn&rsquo;t cover modules, importing, or exporting in this miniseries. Although modules are one of the higher profile features in ES6, and they&rsquo;re easy to get started with, they still have a lot of edge cases that need to be worked out as ES6 is rolled out.</p>

<p>Specifically, ES6 modules have a <code>default</code> export and named exports. CommonJS and AMD only support a single export, and traditionally handle named exports by exporting an object with the named exports as properties. The different ES6 module libraries have different ways of reconciling the differences, so you have to use only default exports or named exports if CommonJS might use the module. How these differences will be reconciled remains to be seen.</p>

<p>That said, the easiest way to start requiring modules is to switch from:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kd">var</span> <span class="nx">_</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">require</span><span class="p">(</span><span class="err">‘</span><span class="nx">lodash</span><span class="err">’</span><span class="p">);</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>`</p>

<p>To the new syntax:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nx">_</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="nx">lodash</span><span class="err">’</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Similarly, you can import relative files using:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kr">import</span> <span class="nx">Router</span> <span class="nx">from</span> <span class="err">‘</span><span class="p">..</span><span class="o">/</span><span class="nx">router</span><span class="err">’</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>When exporting, you can switch from:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="nx">module</span><span class="p">.</span><span class="nx">exports</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>To this:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='javascript'><span class='line'><span class="kr">export</span> <span class="k">default</span> <span class="nx">App</span><span class="p">;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>There’s a bit more to using modules (such as named exports), which we won’t cover today. If you want to learn more, take a look at <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/#modules">this overview</a>.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this miniseries, we took a look at some real-world examples of how you would use ES6 in a client-side JavaScript app. We took a quick look at setting up an ES6 transpile step in your build process, and examined many of the easy-to-use features you can start using right away.</p>

<p>Before you know it, ES6 will be the standard language in use across the web and on servers and personal computers everywhere. Hopefully, this walkthrough will help you get started with a minimum of fuss.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re feeling excited about ES6, and you want to learn more, I would suggest reading through <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/learn-es6/">this overview</a>. Or if you&rsquo;re feeling really enthusiastic, try <a href="https://github.com/getify/You-Dont-Know-JS/tree/master/es6%20%26%20beyond">this book</a>.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/smooth-transition-ecmascript-6-integration">Engine Yard</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;m really excited about the newest version of JavaScript, <em>ECMAScript 6</em> (ES6). But I&rsquo;m also terrified. There&rsquo;s already so much to do between mentoring, contributing to open source, and working on the projects that pay the bills. When will I ever find the time to learn a whole new version of JavaScript?</p>

<p>As developers, it&rsquo;s our blessing and curse to always be learning. When I think about getting ready to adopt ES6, I feel some anxiety about the thought of having to figure out all of the new patterns and APIs it exposes.</p>

<p>In this miniseries, we&rsquo;ll look at some quick and easy ways to integrate ES6 into what you&rsquo;re working on today. Hopefully, by adding ES6 patterns into our coding practice a little at a time, we&rsquo;ll be able to avoid spending a weekend learning the new API when we could be playing outside.</p>

<h2>Looking Ahead to ES6</h2>

<p>ES6 will be the first update to JavaScript since ES5 was finalized in 2009. ES6 was originally slated to come out in 2013, but was then pushed back a couple more times, and is expected to be finalized this month, June 2015.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a lot of JavaScript in programming these days.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s found on the server as <a href="https://nodejs.org/">Node</a>, in <a href="https://developer.apple.com/library/mac/releasenotes/InterapplicationCommunication/RN-JavaScriptForAutomation/">OS X Automation</a>, and of course, in all of the web browsers—where many of us spend most of our time writing JS apps. And we&rsquo;ll be writing ES6 in all of these locations before you know it. It&rsquo;s already standard in <a href="http://www.ember-cli.com/">Ember CLI</a>, <a href="https://www.airpair.com/angularjs/posts/preparing-for-the-future-of-angularjs">Angular 2.0 will be based on it</a>, and is <a href="https://github.com/joyent/node/wiki/ES6-%28a.k.a.-Harmony%29-Features-Implemented-in-V8-and-Available-in-Node">making its way into Node</a> bit by bit.</p>

<p>Thinking ahead, it&rsquo;s clear that JavaScript developers will need to start learning ES6 sooner or later. The good news is, it&rsquo;s a superset of ES5, which means all the ways we currently write code will still work. So we can just write code the way we always have done, until we see places where we can use something from ES6.</p>

<h2>Compatibility</h2>

<p>Before we get into the nitty-gritty of how to start using ES6, a quick note about compatibility. As of this writing, most JavaScript engines are in the process of implementing the features called for by the ES6 spec. To see a list of the features that are slated for release in ES6 (and how they compare with ES5), check out <a href="http://es6-features.org/">this reference</a>. If you want to read about specifically what&rsquo;s available right now, check out this <a href="http://kangax.github.io/compat-table/es6/">compatibility table</a>. In <em>this</em> miniseries, we&rsquo;re going to be focusing on the features that are currently available in the major ES6 engines.</p>

<p>There are many features that haven&rsquo;t been rolled out yet, but can be easily <em>transpiled</em> (transformed and compiled) to ES5 for immediate use. There are several compilers and polyfills available to help with transpiling. My favorite is <a href="https://babeljs.io/">Babel</a>, formerly called 6to5. Babel 5.0 was released on March 31, 2015, and is currently leading other options, with 76% of the spec in place.</p>

<p>Regardless of which transpiler you use, there are several features that are still mostly unsupported across all JS engines. These include: tail calls, WeakMap, WeakSet, Proxy, Reflect, Symbol, new.target, and subclassing built-ins, among others.</p>

<p>Some of these features are available in Babel, but only with experimental mode turned on. For the purposes of this miniseries, we&rsquo;ll be looking at some of the most widely supported, easy-to-use features—so we won&rsquo;t be covering experimental features like these.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re also going to skip over some of the features that are a little more difficult to get started with, such as iterators, generators, and proxies.</p>

<h2>Getting ES6 Into Your Build Process</h2>

<p>Since we can transpile ES6 code to ES5 and start using it everywhere now, it doesn&rsquo;t hurt to get it set up in our build process, so that we can just start using it without having to think twice about it. Luckily, this is really easy to do with Babel.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s beyond the scope of this miniseries to get into all the variations of what you might encounter in getting ES6 into your build process, but you probably won&rsquo;t have much trouble adding it as a step in your existing build process.</p>

<p>There&rsquo;s a Babel plugin available for just about every build setup, including Grunt, Gulp, and Broccoli, and whether you&rsquo;re using Browserify or RequireJS. It even has a built in <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/jsx/">JSX transpiler</a>, making it really easy to use with React. There&rsquo;s a full list of build tools and how to use them [on the Babel website] (<a href="http://babeljs.io/docs/using-babel">http://babeljs.io/docs/using-babel</a>).</p>

<p>You may also want to make use of the <a href="https://babeljs.io/docs/usage/runtime/">babel-runtime</a> package. This is an optional transformer that prevents duplication of common functions during compilation. It also sandboxes your code, aliasing many globals to <code>core-js</code> to avoid polluting the global namespace.</p>

<h3>With Browswerify + NPM Scripts</h3>

<p>Here&rsquo;s a look at how you might add Babel into an existing client-side JS project, using <a href="http://browserify.org/">Browserify</a> and the <a href="https://github.com/babel/babelify">Babelify</a> transform module.</p>

<p>In <code>package.json</code>:</p>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="p">}</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="p">}</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Note that by defining the build script under the <code>postinstall</code> property, it will be run automatically after the package is installed. This might be handy when deploying to <a href="https://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a>, as it will prevent you from having to explicitly call a build in your deploy script.</p>

<h2>Let&rsquo;s Do It</h2>

<p>Now that you&rsquo;ve gotten ES6 set up in your build, you can just start writing it whenever you&rsquo;re developing. Or, if you don&rsquo;t feel like it, you can just fall back to ES5. Remember, it&rsquo;s all valid ES6!</p>

<p>In this post, we talked about the upcoming transition to ES6 everywhere that JavaScript is written. We’ve looked at which ES6 features are currently supported and how to get ES6 into your projects so you can start using it right away.</p>

<p>Make sure to tune tomorrow for part two of this miniseries, where we’ll walk through some of the easiest places to start using ES6 in a typical front-end <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/integrating-react-with-backbone">Backbone + React</a> project.</p>

<p>Until then, happy hacking!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/happy-sad-evil-weird-use-case-planning-practice">Engine Yard</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/happy-sad-evil-weird-feature-planning">part one</a> of this miniseries, we introduced formal Use Case Analysis and a simplified version called Use Case Planning which fits a rapid, iterative development process. That post went over the high-level concepts, and explained how this planning method will help you catch problems with your design before you start to implement.</p>

<p>In this post, the final post of this miniseries, we’ll step through a concrete example so you can see how to put Use Case Planning into practice.</p>

<h2>An Example</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ll imagine that we work for a company that is building a multi-tenant Software as a Service (SaaS) platform where people can set up shops and sell products. Tenants will be able to charge their customers through the platform.</p>

<p>We&rsquo;re part of a team that&rsquo;s getting ready to create a credit card payment acceptance feature. It will be a credit card form common to all of our tenants. We&rsquo;ll be writing the markup by hand and using of <a href="https://stripe.com/">Stripe</a> for processing cards. We&rsquo;re entering a sprint planning meeting to define the scope of the work to be done and decide how long it will take to build.</p>

<p>During this meeting, we&rsquo;ll talk about many different aspects of the billing process. For the purposes of this post, let&rsquo;s hone in on one specific feature: once a user has clicked <em>Buy</em>, they are presented with a credit card form. We want to plan what will happen when they try to make use of this form.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s walk through the Use Case Planning process for this scenario.</p>

<h2>Step 1. Identifying the Actors and Their Roles</h2>

<p>People:</p>

<p><em>User</em>: exchanges money for goods
<em>Merchant</em>: exchanges goods for money and money for tenancy
<em>Platform Owner</em>: exchanges tenancy for money</p>

<p>Services:</p>

<p><em>SaaS Platform</em>: provides the space for tenancy and goods to be exchanged for money
<em>Stripe</em>: verifies and charges credit cards, handles much of <a href="https://www.pcisecuritystandards.org/">PCI compliance</a>
<em>Credit Card Company</em>: transfers funds between other actors</p>

<h2>Step 2. Describe The Purpose of The Feature</h2>

<p>Why do we want to build a credit card form? So that we can debit the user and credit the merchant and platform owner.</p>

<h2>Step 3. Identify Use Case Packages</h2>

<p>In this step, each of the stakeholders will contribute their point of view to the discovery of behaviors that we should consider.</p>

<p>When considering a set of use cases, I often like to think through the alternative paths first. As I mentioned above, they can yield interesting decisions that affect the way the happy path will be built.</p>

<h3>The Sad Path</h3>

<p>This time, we&rsquo;ll start with the sad path. Considering the sad path means thinking through what should happen when one of the actors does something differently than we want them to.</p>

<p>Let&rsquo;s identify some of the sad path use cases of filling out a credit card form.</p>

<p>Here are a few examples:</p>

<ol>
<li>User fills out the credit card form with invalid credit card information</li>
</ol>


<p>When this use case is identified, the designer might chime in that when this happens, the invalid fields should be highlighted and an error message should be displayed explaining what went wrong.</p>

<p>The QA technician might point out that these validations should be ironclad; no special characters should be allowed to pass through.</p>

<ol>
<li>Card is rejected by credit card company</li>
</ol>


<p>Here, the product owner might insist that it should take as few steps as possible to resubmit the form, so that the user doesn&rsquo;t become frustrated and decide not to buy the product.</p>

<ol>
<li>Stripe accepts card when submitted via JavaScript, but fails on subsequent server charge request</li>
</ol>


<p>The developer would want to make sure that passing error handling from the server back to the front end is captured in this use case.</p>

<h3>The Evil Path</h3>

<p>Coming up with evil paths requires to you to think like an attacker. How many ways can you come up with to exploit the feature you’re trying to build?</p>

<p>For example:</p>

<ol>
<li>Price as set in a hidden form field and user figures out that they can change it to zero</li>
</ol>


<p>In this scenario, the developer would want to make sure that the form is built correctly.</p>

<ol>
<li>Hacker steals credit card info from the database, server logs, or an insecure network request sent over HTTP</li>
</ol>


<p>The product owner would want to mitigate against this as much as is possible so as the protect the customer’s data. From a legal perspective, the product owner would also want to ensure that the SaaS company could not be held liable for any losses, and crucially, that PCI compliance was met.</p>

<ol>
<li>If we were to save the credit card information to the user account, a hacker could launch a <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_request_forgery">CSRF attack</a>, leveraging a logged in user&rsquo;s account information to order products without authorization.</li>
</ol>


<p>The developer would suggest using a CSRF token, and the QA technician would want to make sure that form submission failed when the token was changed.</p>

<ol>
<li>Security holes in session or authentication opens users up to charges</li>
</ol>


<p>Here, the QA technician might ask what would happen when cookie or local storage data is changed. Does it fail as it should?</p>

<h3>The Weird Path</h3>

<p>Coming up with weird paths requires a little more creativity.</p>

<p>Consider each component that your feature interacts with (both internally and externally, locally and remotely, and so on) and think through what would happen if that component failed or behaved in an unexpected way.</p>

<p>For instance:</p>

<ol>
<li>JavaScript is disabled in the user’s browser, and  the event listener that would prevent the form from being submitted doesn’t fire. The <code>form</code> element falls back to its default behavior, which is to submit it to the SaaS server. The credit card number now appears in the server logs, making it vulnerable to information theft.</li>
</ol>


<p>The developer would want to ensure that the form is built such that it would never be submitted to the SaaS server by mistake.</p>

<ol>
<li>Stripe server is down</li>
</ol>


<p>In this case, the designer would ask for some kind of error page, perhaps with a link to a status page where users could check for the servers to come back online.</p>

<ol>
<li>Connection to Stripe is interrupted during transaction</li>
</ol>


<p>The product owner might ask if we can resend the submission if the connection was interrupted. The developer would probably push back on that request, for security reasons. As a compromise, the designer might offer to invent an error state to be shown in this case.</p>

<h3>The Happy Path</h3>

<p>This one is easy. How do you want the feature to work?</p>

<ol>
<li>User successfully fills out form and clicks submit</li>
</ol>


<p>Again, the designer would probably like to display some kind of success message here.</p>

<ol>
<li>Credit card charge is accepted by Stripe</li>
</ol>


<p>In this scenario, the product owner might ask to have the page views leading to the successful charge tracked in an analytics service, so we could track down and encourage the same behavior in the future.</p>

<h2>Step 4. Name and Diagram Use Cases</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve now identified twelve use cases for the credit card form feature.</p>

<p>I tried my hand at documenting them all in a Use Case Diagram. Green arrows represent good requests or responses, and red arrows represent errors. Bombs represent a broken network connection.</p>

<p><img src="" alt="" /></p>

<p>As you can see, there are tons of arrows.</p>

<p>There are a lot of possible scenarios, and a lot of possible communications between the actors in the system. If we hadn&rsquo;t taken the time to think them through and uncover them all, there&rsquo;s high probability that we would have left some of these out.</p>

<h2>Converting To User Stories</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve gone through these four steps, we&rsquo;ve come out with something very valuable: bite-sized sentences that can be translated directly into stories and entered into our tracker software.</p>

<p>Here&rsquo;s what the first sad path case might look like when worded as a story:</p>

<figure class='code'><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class=''><span class='line'>As a user, when I complete the form with invalid information and click submit, I should see the invalid inputs become highlighted, and I should see validation errors telling me what went wrong so that I can correct my error and successfully buy products.</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>As you can see, we have an actor (user), action (fill out and submit form), a result (show validation errors), and a business purpose (the user can give us money).</p>

<p>These twelve stories are small and clear, and lend themselves to being prioritized based on the priorities of our business. Once we enter them into our tracker, we can be assured that they will all be built, and we can estimate how long it will take to happen.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>The Use Case Planning process is not super complicated. It consists of identifying who/what is involved, why we care, what should happen in the happy and alternative scenarios, and how do the scenarios relate?</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a relatively low level of effort to answer these four questions and break down the scenarios, but the result is worth its weight in gold. It enables us to identify architectural concerns and edge cases early on and change them at a low cost. We&rsquo;ve also ended up with a set of small stories with clear acceptance criteria that we can track, providing a huge value both in accountability and estimating timelines.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/happy-sad-evil-weird-feature-planning">Engine Yard</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>When building software iteratively, feature planning has to  be done early and often. But it can be a complicated process due to all of the stakeholders involved, each with different viewpoints and goals.</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s more, it&rsquo;s easy to overlook key behaviors of a feature, which can lead to expensive and rushed code later. It&rsquo;s usually intuitive to figure what should happen when everything goes according to plan, but what about edge cases? What should happen when a user supplies bad data? A hacker launches a malicious attack on our application? What about when <a href="https://github.com/Netflix/SimianArmy">chaos makes the whole system unstable</a>?</p>

<p>In the first post of this miniseries, we&rsquo;ll take a look at one way to get everyone&rsquo;s voice heard in the planning process, including the product owner, developer, designer, and QA engineer. Using this approach, teams can draw on their diverse perspectives to tease out a detailed blueprint of a feature that costs less and performs better.</p>

<h2>Introducing Use Case Planning</h2>

<p>Use Case Planning is a term that I&rsquo;ve come up with to represent a simplified version of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use-case_analysis">Use Case Analysis</a>. I&rsquo;m aiming to simplify the software feature planning process into a simple, reusable procedure that will save teams money and build more robust systems.</p>

<p>With Use Case Planning, teams can stay flexible early in the game, when it&rsquo;s still cheap to make big changes to the system.</p>

<p>It also helps us look ahead and find edge cases. For many people, it&rsquo;s easy to press forward naïvely, writing stories about how a feature should behave entirely in terms of the best-case scenario (also known as the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Happy_path">Happy or Golden Path</a>). But there are many other cases to consider. What about bad data (Sad Path), hacker attacks (Evil Path), or web services going down (Weird Path)?</p>

<p>In the end, thinking through these scenarios in advance of development will save a company money and result in features that provide a better user experience.</p>

<h2>What Is Use Case Planning?</h2>

<h3>Background</h3>

<p>If you&rsquo;re not familiar with Use Case Analysis, it&rsquo;s an academic approach based in <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Object-oriented_analysis_and_design">Object Oriented Analysis</a>—a way of describing any kind of system (not just software) in terms of conceptual objects.</p>

<p>I first became aware of Use Case Analysis through the work of <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~mark/">Mark Shacklette</a>, a professor of Computer Science at the University of Chicago. In <a href="http://people.cs.uchicago.edu/~mark/51023/Ucstyleg.html">this paper</a>, he lays out a very detailed process for building systems with Use Case Analysis. However, I found it to be over-complicated for regular use. I build a lot of software for clients, and need a &ldquo;boiled down&rdquo; version that I can reach for when planning sessions are  constrained by time. Use Case Planning is my attempt at creating that.</p>

<h3>What&rsquo;s Required?</h3>

<p>In the software industry, when we&rsquo;re getting ready to build a feature, we have to answer three basic questions:</p>

<p>What&rsquo;s required to build it?
How should it behave?
What people and computer systems are involved?</p>

<p>Through the Use Case Planning process, we&rsquo;ll answer these questions and come out with a  blueprint detailing what we need, the dependencies involved, and the ways our feature should work.</p>

<h3>Who&rsquo;s Involved?</h3>

<p>Feature planning is usually carried out by a team of stakeholders rather than an individual. Product owners, developers, designers, QA technicians, and so on all bring a unique perspective and set of concerns to the table. Drawing on these varied mindsets helps us make a more comprehensive plan than we could come up with on our own</p>

<h3>Scenarios</h3>

<p>Let&rsquo;s imagine we&rsquo;re on such a team, and we want to plan a feature with Use Case Planning. We&rsquo;ll need to break it down into as many use cases, or scenarios, as we can, weaving a story of interactions between people of various roles and the computer systems involved.</p>

<h2>Why Think About Use Cases?</h2>

<p>There are many benefits to breaking down a feature into use cases.</p>

<p>First of all, talking through software&rsquo;s desired behavior in simple everyday language opens the conversation up to all stakeholders. The whole team can work together to determine how a feature should work without jargon getting in the way.</p>

<p>The team involved in the planning process is essentially trying to define a <em>contract</em> of what will be built and what it will do. Use Case Planning makes this contract more resistant to change, as unforeseen circumstances are accounted for before the first line of code is ever written. Also, functional parts of the system are less likely to fall through the cracks when a variety of scenarios are considered up front.</p>

<p>This approach can also help guide architectural decisions. Sometimes, a feature can be ruled out entirely, before any time is ever spent building it. For example, concern about having bots or script-generated users in a system could push a team toward including an email confirmation workflow, or choosing <a href="http://oauth.net/">oAuth</a> over traditional authentication.</p>

<p>In my mind, perhaps the most valuable benefit of use case analysis is that it gives teams a way to describe a system that costs very little to modify. In talking through alternate paths early, it&rsquo;s easy to change requirements before anything&rsquo;s ever built. This is a huge win, because as time goes on, code is written, and the system begins to take shape, the cost of change increases significantly.</p>

<p>Adding and removing features from a use case story or diagram is easy. Changing them in UX flow diagrams and wireframes is harder, in design comps harder still, in development code even harder, and in a production app it can be extremely hard. But when you&rsquo;re planning, making changes is as easy as throwing away a sticky note and writing a new one, so it pays to think through as many of the potential scenarios as possible at this early stage.</p>

<h2>How To Do Use Case Planning</h2>

<p>Now that we&rsquo;ve talked about the benefits and goals of use case planning, <em>what exactly is it</em>? As I mentioned above, this is my attempt at boiling Use Case Analysis down into a set of memorable, repeatable steps. They mirror the steps in Mark Shacklette&rsquo;s original paper pretty closely, but I&rsquo;ve tried to rework them to the minimum of what I think <em>I</em> would need when planning a feature before beginning work.</p>

<h3>The Four Steps</h3>

<p>To complete the four steps, answer these four questions:</p>

<ol>
<li>Who are the actors and what are their roles?</li>
<li>What&rsquo;s the purpose of this feature?</li>
<li>What are the use cases?</li>
<li>How do the use cases relate to each other?</li>
</ol>


<p>In thinking about the first question, we&rsquo;ll expand our definition of &ldquo;actors&rdquo; from just people to include everything that interacts with the system: users, administrators, our client-side application, our API, external APIs, cloud services, and hardware interfaces. Each of these actors has a role and a responsibility in the system that we should identify.</p>

<p>In identifying the purpose of the feature, we are just looking for a high-level summary of why we care about it. What&rsquo;s the business value?</p>

<p>When we get to the third question, we&rsquo;re ready to dig into the meat of this process. We&rsquo;ll think through all of the use and misuse cases, considering the Happy, Sad, Evil and Weird paths. For each one, we&rsquo;ll choose a a noun (the actor), verb (actions taken), and a brief description of the desired result. We can also optionally add a more specific purpose (like we identified in step two) to each case as we go.</p>

<p>After step three, we will have identified many use cases, each with a name, an actor, and a breakdown of all the required behavior. Using this information, we can answer the last question (how do they relate?) by diagramming their interactions. There&rsquo;s an example of a use case diagram for ordering at a restaurant <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Use_Case_Diagram#/media/File:Use_case_restaurant_model.svg">on Wikipedia</a>.</p>

<p>The diagram is in a formal Use Case Analysis style. For the purposes of planning software, it might make sense to replace this style of diagramming with a UX flow diagram, using the screens in the app to delineate how the feature should behave.</p>

<h3>Wrapping It Up</h3>

<p>Once we&rsquo;ve identified the various use cases associated with our feature, we can translate these results directly into agile stories. Using a tracking tool like <a href="https://sprint.ly">Sprint.ly</a>, we can then prioritize the work that needs to be done and estimate the time it will take to complete the feature. Each user case can be sized, tagged, and tracked, providing a helpful look into the progress being made toward bringing our feature to fruition.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In this post, we introduced formal Use Case Analysis and a simplified version called Use Case Planning which fits a rapid, iterative development process. We went over the benefits, the steps involved, and explained how this planning method will help your team catch problems with your design before you start to implement it.</p>

<p>That’s it for this post, but tune in next week for part two (the final part) of this miniseries, where we’ll be stepping through a concrete example so you can see how to put Use Case Planning into practice.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2015/actually-mvp">Engine Yard</a>.</p>

<h2>Introduction</h2>

<p>In the startup world, there is a lot of talk about building <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Minimum_viable_product">Minimum Viable Products</a></em> (MVPs). At this point, the concept has become so well-accepted that it has almost become a kind of unquestioned dogma. Yet there is a lot of disagreement about what MVP is exactly, and how to carry it out. Many people in the software industry assume that they know what MVP means, and claim to be using the process, but their production workflow tells a different story.</p>

<p>When it comes to building software, it is often tempting to take an approach akin to building a skyscraper: write the blueprints, obtain the necessary prerequisites, then build it to spec. But software is a quickly shifting market. A businessperson may think she knows what the market wants, and plan and begin a project to meet that desire. But by the time the product is built, the needs of consumers have often morphed in a direction that she could never have foreseen.</p>

<p>In this post, we&rsquo;ll take explore some common misconceptions about MVP, some different ways to approach building one with software, and how to best use this tool if you&rsquo;re the CEO or CTO of a startup, a product manager for an established company, or a consultant.</p>

<h2>Why MVP?</h2>

<p>We hear a lot of talk about MVP and its value, but as a businessperson, why should you care? The reason is simple: it prevents you from spending money building a product that nobody wants.</p>

<p>When you build your business around small, successive iterations, the time before you can reflect on lessons learned is as small as possible. It can even push you to decide <em>not</em> to build your big idea, saving you valuable time and resources.</p>

<p>Another great benefit of an MVP approach is that it allows you to test a hypothesis with minimal resources. If you have no money in the bank, you can still <a href="http://venturebeat.com/2013/12/10/homeless-coder-prevails-over-skeptics-releases-mobile-app-to-get-off-the-streets/">get something off the ground</a>.</p>

<h2>History</h2>

<p>In the startup world, the idea of MVP was popularized by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Four-Steps-Epiphany-Steve-Blank/dp/0989200507">Steve Blank</a> and <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/10/about-author.html">Eric Ries</a>. Eric&rsquo;s 2008 blog post, <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/lean-startup.html">The Lean Startup</a>, kicked off a movement in software development toward building companies around the idea of testing business hypotheses in an iterative way. The idea of MVP is central to this approach, and has become part of the <em>lingua franca</em> of startup culture.</p>

<p>The origins of MVP (and lean software development) draw on the Toyota corporation&rsquo;s <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lean_manufacturing">lean manufacturing approach</a>, called the <em>Toyota Production System</em> (TPS). Toyota bigwig <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Taiichi_Ohno">Taiichi Ohno</a> coined the idea of &ldquo;Just In Time&rdquo; production, in which return on investment is maximized by reducing inventory.</p>

<p>Among other things, the TPS introduced the idea of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Kanban">Kanban</a>. The key takeaway of TPS as it applies to software is this: <strong><em>production is determined according to the actual demand of the customer</em></strong>.</p>

<h2>It&rsquo;s Not What You Think It Is</h2>

<p>We&rsquo;ve all seen this picture right?</p>

<p><img src="https://blog.engineyard.com/images/blog-images/actually-mvp.png" alt="" /></p>

<p>Raise your hand if you think it&rsquo;s a good idea.</p>

<p>Now raise your hand if you think you actually follow it. Really? Are you sure you didn&rsquo;t motorize your skateboard? Put a steering wheel on your bike? Let me ask you this: did you actually do a customer interview at any point to see if they even <em>wanted</em> a car?</p>

<p>An MVP may not be what you think it is. Eric Ries <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/08/minimum-viable-product-guide.html">defines it</a> as &ldquo;that version of a new product which allows a team to collect the maximum amount of validated learning about customers with the least effort&rdquo;. What does that actually mean?</p>

<p>It means building just enough of a product to be deployed and used. It&rsquo;s the <em>minimum</em> feature set that you need to find out whether it makes sense to invest further in an idea. If you&rsquo;re building a dating site for dogs, what do you need? Profiles and messaging. You don&rsquo;t need favoriting, automated emails, or the ability to see who viewed your profile.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re breaking ground with a new idea, you can ask yourself: would people use this?
If you&rsquo;re spinning something that&rsquo;s already out there, ask: would people love this more than what they&rsquo;re using now?</p>

<p>Then answer that question. Build profiles and messaging, put it in front of some users, and see if they love it. Track clicks, invite them in for an interview, get their email and reach out personally. Identify <em><a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Performance_indicator">Key Performance Indicators</a></em> (KPIs) and use them to verify success.</p>

<p>If they love it, keep going! Add a link to favoriting that doesn&rsquo;t work. Track clicks. If enough people are trying to favorite, build it. Invite users in for an interview. Get their email and reach out personally.</p>

<p>If you try several different feature sets and find out that nobody wants a dating site for dogs, it&rsquo;s ok. In fact, that&rsquo;s great. That means you really did it. You tested the market cheaply <em>before</em> you sunk bags of money into building Doggie Dates. That&rsquo;s a win.</p>

<p>An MVP is not just doing sprints to build your product over time. It’s an <em>experimental process</em>.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s a small vision, tested and validated thoroughly before moving forward.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s not twelve weeks of development and a release.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s continuous deployment.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s <a href="http://vincentjordan.com/2012/01/why-is-your-minimal-viable-product-mvp-really-just-a-pos/">not a buggy alpha site</a> with ten features that <em>kind of</em> work.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s the two most defining features needed for the product to be useful.</p>

<p>It&rsquo;s bare, not broken.</p>

<p>On the other hand, an MVP approach is <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html">not just <em>release early, release often</em></a>, either. Yes, build a small thing. Yes, gather feedback and incorporate it. But don&rsquo;t let the feedback cause you to pivot so hard that you can&rsquo;t remember what you were trying to do in the first place. If you find yourself testing Amazon for dog toys instead of a dating site for dogs, you haven’t pivoted for product-market fit, you’ve pivoted to an entirely new idea.</p>

<p>Start with a vision and stay true to it. Build the skeleton, and let feedback from early users help you flesh out the details.</p>

<h2>Really MVP</h2>

<p>So you want to build a thing, huh? You&rsquo;re going to change the world, like Steve Jobs? Slow down there, buckaroo! I hope you know what you&rsquo;re getting into.</p>

<p>According to <a href="http://get2growth.com/how-many-startups/">this article</a>, there were 1.35 million tech startups as of February 2014. Before you start dreaming of all that VC cash and crack your wallet open to get things off the ground, why don&rsquo;t you do a little experiment to see if it&rsquo;s at all likely that you&rsquo;ll end up anywhere besides broke.</p>

<p>The lean startup approach is all about the <a href="http://theleanstartup.com/principles">build-measure-learn</a> cycle. Before you have a company, you&rsquo;ll have to start by building something.</p>

<h3>First Step: Build</h3>

<p>What&rsquo;s the smallest first step you can take?</p>

<p>The classic example of an MVP you can use to test an idea is a landing page with a sign up form. The idea is to build a pixel-perfect landing page touting all the benefits of joining Doggie Dates and deploy it on an easy-to-use platform like <a href="https://www.engineyard.com/">Engine Yard</a>. Then you drive users to the site by purchasing some Google AdWords, and entice them to sign up with their email for early access to the application.</p>

<p>There has been some recent debate as to whether a landing page is even an MVP. Although some would say no, like <a href="http://ramlijohn.com/a-landing-page-is-not-a-minimum-viable-product/">Ramli John</a>, this strategy doesn&rsquo;t provide enough insight to complete the build-measure-learn cycle. <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2009/03/minimum-viable-product.html">Eric Reis</a> and <a href="https://medium.com/@joelgascoigne/how-to-successfully-validate-your-idea-with-a-landing-page-mvp-ef3c2d02dc51">others</a> seem to disagree. A landing page <em>can</em> provide enough information to build a successive MVP and continue to gather feedback. If they sign up they&rsquo;re probably interested in what you&rsquo;re selling.</p>

<p>Although Ramli John isn&rsquo;t a fan of landing pages, he does have some other great suggestions for ways to build a first MVP. Some startups, like AngelList, have begun as an email list. Blogs can be another great place to gather interested users. We&rsquo;ve talked about Eric Reis quite a bit already. His <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008_08_01_archive.html">blog</a> covered topics like refactoring, TDD, and fundraising before he was known for the Lean Startup. You can try getting off the ground with a video and a startup campaign. Finally, you can do it the old fashioned way: <em>the hustle</em>. Just sell your service. In person. <em>Before</em> you build an app.</p>

<p>Landing pages are great for founders of small startups and developers with a great idea for a side project, but what does MVP mean if you have another sort of job?</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a consultant like me, encourage your clients to prioritize their feature requests. We have so many awesome things in mind for Doggie Dating! Favoriting, profile walls, see who viewed me, a Dogs You Might Dig service, responsive layouts, native mobile versions&hellip; The list goes on and on. It&rsquo;s great to write them all down and put them in a tracking tool like <a href="https://sprint.ly/">Sprint.ly</a>, so that you don&rsquo;t lose all these creative ideas. Then it&rsquo;s time to prioritize.</p>

<p>What do you need first? What is the smallest version of your idea that people (or dogs) could possibly use? Put those tickets at the top of your tracker, and mark the point when they&rsquo;ll be done with a release bar. Encourage your clients to ask themselves: &ldquo;is this necessary for people to use the site?&rdquo; before you put <em>anything</em> above that bar.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve reached it, follow the steps below! Measure and learn before you go on. That way, you can collectively decide what should <em>actually</em> be built, instead of spending the client&rsquo;s money building things that are going end up being discarded.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re a Product Owner, maybe you&rsquo;re charged with exploring new ways that your company can gain more users, or convince the existing ones to pay more. There are some cool tricks you can use to sneak a feature MVP into what&rsquo;s already there. You can make  links that claim to take the user to one or more features, but are actually inactive (preferably with a modal dialogue to explain what’s going on). Then you track the clicks and decide what to build from there. Or you can ask users to pay for a certain feature before you actually begin development on it. If you don&rsquo;t reach a certain threshold of sign-ups, you just cancel it, apologize, and refund the money.</p>

<p>No matter your role, if people don&rsquo;t seem to want what you&rsquo;ve put out there, delete it and build another version of your dream. Be happy about all the time and money you just saved by not building something that nobody wants! Keep going until you find something that sticks. In this way, you&rsquo;ll set up a great foundation on which to build the rest of your business.</p>

<h3>Second Step: Measure</h3>

<p>Regardless of how you choose to build the first version of your idea, you&rsquo;ll want to measure user engagement once it&rsquo;s deployed. The easiest way to do this is to add Google Analytics into the page and track clicks and pageviews. Reflecting on this information, you&rsquo;ll begin to learn what people want. If anyone actually signs up on your landing page with their email, you can reach out personally (maybe even take them to lunch) and ask them questions to learn more about what people would want to use.</p>

<p>Once you&rsquo;ve gotten past the first iteration of your MVP, you can also invite customers to user testing sessions. These sessions can offer great insight into how your application should behave, and which features are misunderstood or unwanted. Finally, <a href="http://www.startuplessonslearned.com/2008/09/one-line-split-test-or-how-to-ab-all.html">A/B testing</a> can be a great way to research which direction to go next once you&rsquo;ve passed the early stages.</p>

<h3>Third Step: Learn</h3>

<p>After you&rsquo;ve measured clicks, user responses, user testing, and A/B testing results, you can begin to draw conclusions. Maybe dating dogs don&rsquo;t care about favoriting. Delete that feature. Maybe you heard over and over again that having a profile &ldquo;wall&rdquo; would make a huge difference to users. Perhaps that should be the next thing you build?</p>

<p>You need to sift through all of the information that you get and decide how to act.</p>

<h2>Conclusion</h2>

<p>In the software industry, a lot of people pay lip service to the idea of a Minimum Viable Product. But for many of us, it&rsquo;s not what you think it is.</p>

<p>If you&rsquo;re thinking: I know what people want, and I&rsquo;m going to build it, you&rsquo;ve already misunderstood the process. MVPs are experiments, research. How you use them differs a little bit depending on your situation, but the basic premise is the same. Build a small thing, measure the way it&rsquo;s used, learn from it, repeat.</p>
