  <div class="entry-content"><p>The first couple weeks of gSchool basically consisted of: our teachers (Jeff, Katrina, Franklin, and Jorge) throwing us into the deep end and watching to see if we would sink or swim. Within the first seven days of class, we were assigned the following tutorials: Ruby in 100 Minutes, EventManager, MicroBlogger, Encryptor, <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/testing_event_manager.html">TDD With Minitest and EventManager</a>, and <a href="https://github.com/JumpstartLab/enums-exercises.git">EnumsExercises</a>.</p>

<p>Then they dropped the real bomb.</p>

<p><a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/event_reporter.html">EventReporter</a>. In this project, you &ldquo;build an interactive query and reporting tool&rdquo; that inspects CSV files. After loading a file, it lets the user search through the data to find entries by attributes like name, phone number, and address. <a href="git@github.com:fluxusfrequency/event_reporter.git">My version is here</a>.</p>

<p>This was the first project in which we had to engineer solutions to a problem without having our hands held every step of the way. The tutorial gives some guidance, in the form of various &ldquo;paths&rdquo; with guidelines to be met. I guess this is the &ldquo;we do&rdquo; step of the guided release process (&ldquo;I do&rdquo;, &ldquo;we do&rdquo;, &ldquo;you do&rdquo;). At any rate, we found ourselves out in the wild, trying to hack out a way to victory. Each of us had to find our own process; develop a workflow to find a way out.</p>

<p>I was paired with Persa for this project. The instructions said that we were each to turn in our own solution, relying on each other for support as we went. I was determined to figure out how to create a working solution, and my learning style is very independent. It seems that Persa is the same way. We didn&rsquo;t spend much time in collaboration. We troubleshot each others&#8217; problems, but only minimally. Mostly we each worked alone, with a little consultation from the teachers or other students.</p>

<p>For me, the project was basically all-consuming from Tuesday morning through Thursday morning. I&rsquo;m not sure how many hours I spent on it in total, but I will say that I spent all of my time at Galvanize (about 8:00-5:00) on it each day (when I wasn&rsquo;t in class), plus about three hours on the bus each day, and a few extra hours at home on top of all that.</p>

<p>My strategy was to write tests for each of the five paths from the tutorial. Here&rsquo;s the code from my &ldquo;Happy Path&rdquo; test:</p>

<p>After writing the tests, I wrote code to make the tests pass, one at a time. I repeated this process for all five paths. By the time I was done, I had a 95% functional program. I did a few tweaks here and there, and had something that worked by Thursday morning. I did it, but it was a haul. I enjoyed reading this 10:00 PM email from Jeff on Wednesday night:</p>

</span><span class='line'>It will be ok :)</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Ha ha. Right, Jeff. <em>That&rsquo;s</em> what we&rsquo;re going to do.</p>

<p>Meanwhile, class was still going on each day. Franklin did a great couple of sessions on debugging, and introduced us to <a href="http://pryrepl.org/">Pry</a>. Wow, it&rsquo;s amazing! I loved being able to stop code as it was running ro check out the value of different variables, and explore what would happen when calling different methods during runtime. It blew my mind, and <em>really</em> helped with debugging. Katrina opened my eyes to a new tool too: minitest/pride. In her words, &ldquo;pride is very important!&rdquo; I&rsquo;m very excited by colors (as you can read about in <a href="blog/2013/09/19/fun-with-terminal/">yesterday&rsquo;s post</a>), and I seriously don&rsquo;t know if I could have run the tests over and over without the rainbows to brighten my day (or night).</p>

<p>Even though the project is &ldquo;done&rdquo;, I&rsquo;m still working on it. I&rsquo;m not surprised, and I&rsquo;m sure this will always be the case with my code. Most of the work I&rsquo;m doing now is based on the refactoring suggestions Franklin made during the code review I went through with Rolen, Will, Simon, Quentin, Ben H., and Nathaniel on Thursday morning.</p>

<p>Things I&rsquo;m trying do to my code:</p>

<ul>
<li>Write method names clearly</li>
<li>Shorten methods</li>
<li>Split if/else statements into separate methods</li>
<li>Change variable assignments into methods that return an array or hash, when appropriate</li>
<li>Routing all the &ldquo;puts&rdquo; calls through a &ldquo;say&rdquo; method, so that I can run tests without seeing a bunch of garbage on the screen.</li>
</ul>


<p>After seeing my classmates&#8217; code, and listening to Franklin&rsquo;s ideas, my whole understanding of Ruby syntax and ways of approaching problems has expanded many times over. It&rsquo;s going to take a long time to integrate everything I&rsquo;ve seen this week into my coding.</p>

<p>A couple of things I did that worked really well for me were:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using pomodoros to keep from getting burned out</li>
<li>Driving feature implementation using tests</li>
<li>Splitting collections of methods into separate classes</li>
<li>Using namespacing</li>
<li>Using git branches and pushing often</li>
<li>Drinking coffee listening to music on big headphones while coding :)</li>
</ul>


<p>Things that didn&rsquo;t work as well:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using really big methods,</li>
<li>Using a lot of puts statements at the end of my methods (making it hard to test)</li>
<li>Continually switching between open windows instead of splitting them in a way that makes sense</li>
</ul>


<p>All in all, I had a great time with EventReporter. It was fun for me to define a large number of problems, and solve them one at a time until I&rsquo;d built something cool.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>I love the terminal.</p>

<p>When I first wanted to check out coding, the first exercises I tried were the Javascript ones on <a href="http://www.codecademy.com">Codecademy</a>. I was soon addicted. Something about them felt very familiar in a way that I couldn&rsquo;t put my finger on. I think it may have been the fixed width font. Or maybe it was just the process of interacting with a lot of plain text on the screen instead of a flashy UI (<strong>cough</strong> OS X <strong>cough</strong>). It brought me back to the old days&hellip;</p>

<p>That&rsquo;s because my <a href="http://www.clintlewis.com">dad</a> is a programmer. My grandpa too. Pop brought home a 286 when I was five years old. I think he mostly uses C# these days. He&rsquo;s moved from Windows, to Sun, to some obscure stack I have no comprehension of. <em>Update - I got a message from Pop that said: &ldquo;For the record, most of my coding these days is in Java supporting Oracle ADF running in a Weblogic environment. Very corporate.&rdquo;</em> But when he was just getting started, it was all about MS-DOS. He taught me everything I needed to know; showed me all the right things to type. Commands like cd, dir, mkdir, copy, edit, help. How to search with *.*. One of my favorite programs was &ldquo;simcga&rdquo;, which simulated a cga graphics card so we could play color games on our monochrome monitor (the output was orange). I spent hours playing games like <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmqIZMBbMVs">Tapper</a>. Ctl + Alt + Del was a very important key combination to me. I liked to play Tetris, but I hated to make mistakes, and I thought it was easier to just restart the entire system than to try to figure out how to fix a couple of badly placed blocks. The best program was &ldquo;helpletmeout.exe&rdquo;, which directed the computer to speak the words: &ldquo;help, let me out. I&rsquo;m trapped in this computer&rdquo; through its very primative built-in speaker. I got pretty effecient at finding my way around the computer and using DOS commands.</p>

<p>When Windows 3.1 was around, I still did a lot of navigating with DOS, but when Windows 95 came out, it became a lot less necessary, and a lot more inconvenient, to access. I remember being pretty bummed out about it at first. But eventually I gave in and started doing all of my file system work through Windows Explorer. It stayed that way until I switched over to Mac in college. Trading Windows XP for OS X, I found myself even further estranged from my DOS roots. Even if I had known that I could access the Unix terminal from OS X, I would have had no idea what to type.</p>

<p>But when I started exploring JS on Codecademy, I got the bug again. I was having fun interacting with the computer through plain text. As I continued to teach myself on their website, and on <a href="http://www.codeschool.com">Code School</a> and <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a>, I found out that if I was going to build web applications, I was going to have to learn a little bit of Unix. At first it was intimidating and overwhelming.</p>

<p>Where am I? What? &ldquo;ls&rdquo;? That&rsquo;s not intuitive. Where&rsquo;s &ldquo;dir&rdquo;? At least &ldquo;cd&rdquo; works. Hm, ok, now I&rsquo;m starting to get the hang of it. &ldquo;pwd&rdquo;.
&ldquo;rm&rdquo;. &ldquo;pushd&rdquo; and &ldquo;popd&rdquo;! Now I&rsquo;m getting excited. &ldquo;chown&rdquo; and &ldquo;chmod&rdquo;! I remember kids throwing those ones around in high school when we were wannabe l33t haX0rs!</p>

<p>I had to work at getting comfortable in the bash terminal. But after forcing myself to just try, I actually found myself quite at home. After working on it for several months, I started love, love, love it.</p>

<p>The next logical step was to make it look really cool. So I googled around a bit, and found the <a href="http://ethanschoonover.com/solarized">Solarized</a> terminal theme. After trying it out, I burned through multiple themes before deciding that it was easier for me to see <a href="https://github.com/jperkins/IR-Black">IR-Black</a>. Next, I thought it would be cool to change the colors in my prompt too. I found <a href="http://wiki.dreamhost.com/Environment_Setup">this tutorial</a> from Dreamhost on setting up your environment. I added for this line of code to my .bash_profile to get some cool colors:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>PS1 Variable</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PS1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s1">&#39;\[\033[1;33m\]\u\[\033[1;37m\]@\[\033[1;32m\]\h\[\033[1;37m\]:\[\033[1;31m\]\w \[\033[1;36m\]\$ \[\033[0m\]&#39;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Looks like alphabet soup. Or number soup. While I was there, I noticed they had a cool startup graphic. I decided that I wanted a dragon. So I found some ASCII art of a dragon from Joan Stark&rsquo;s awesome Geocities (!!) <a href="http://www.geocities.com/spunk1111/">homepage</a>. Now my terminal boots with this:</p>

<p>Once I&rsquo;d gone this far, I figured I might as well keep going with the customization. So I took another look at the prompt and found other things to add. Here are a couple of useful code bits I added: one to show which <a href="https://gist.github.com/fabiodan/1649280">git branch</a> I was working from, and one to show which <a href="http://rvm.io/workflow/prompt">ruby version</a> I was using. Here&rsquo;s what those two modifications look like in my .bash_profile:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>Git and RVM in Prompt</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="c"># Git branch in prompt.</span>
</span><span class='line'>parse_git_branch<span class="o">()</span> <span class="o">{</span>
</span><span class='line'>    git branch 2&gt; /dev/null <span class="p">|</span> sed -e <span class="s1">&#39;/^[^*]/d&#39;</span> -e <span class="s1">&#39;s/* \(.*\)/ (\1)/&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="o">}</span>
</span><span class='line'>
</span><span class='line'><span class="c">#Display ruby version with rvm.</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="nv">PS1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;\$(~/.rvm/bin/rvm-prompt) $PS1&quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After I did all of that, I had to update my PS1 variable a little more:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span>PS1 Variable</span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='bash'><span class='line'><span class="nb">export </span><span class="nv">PS1</span><span class="o">=</span><span class="s2">&quot;\[\033[33;1m\]\W\[\033[32m\]\$(parse_git_branch)\[\033[00m\] $ &quot;</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>After all of these modifications, here&rsquo;s what my startup screen looks like:</p>

<p><img src="http://s16.postimg.org/y2dy0ulxx/terminal_screenshot.png" title="Terminal Screenshot" alt="An image of my terminal screen"></p>

<p><strong><em>UPDATE</em></strong></p>

<p>After writing this blog post, I just had my mind blown by my classmates Nathaniel Watts, Rolen Le, and Quentin Tai. They showed me a whole slew of new terminal concepts that completely melted my brain.</p>

<p>On the menu:</p>

<ul>
<li>Using <a href="http://www.iterm2.com/#/section/home">iTerm</a> instead of the Terminal utility that ships with OS X. Apparently it is much better maintained.</li>
<li>Learning to use Vim. I&rsquo;m excited to see that fuzzy search and syntax highlighting are easy to get working. I just ran vimtutor from the terminal to get started. Now I know about 0.5% of what there is to know about Vim.</li>
<li>Learning to use <a href="http://robots.thoughtbot.com/post/2641409235/a-tmux-crash-course">Tmux</a>. Holy crap this looks great for screen sharing.</li>
<li>Using <a href="https://github.com/guard/guard">Guard</a> to listen for changes as I try to make tests pass.</li>
<li>Splitting the screen to have vim editing your code on the left, while guard is running in another pane on the right.</li>
</ul>


<p>Combining all of these concepts is ridiculously powerful. It means you can have all of your projects open concurrently in separate tmux sessions, with the code open in Vim and Guard listening for changes on each one. To resume work on a project, all you have to do is open the terminal and resume the tmux session for that project.</p>

<p>Sound confusing? I agree! But I&rsquo;m excited to see the power that&rsquo;s available if I take the time to learn how to use it. Who would have realized that simple text applications could do so much? Regardless of the work involved, one thing is for sure. I am even more in love with the terminal than I was before!</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>We&rsquo;re now into the second week of gSchool. It has been an intense six days thus far. The Jumpstart Lab crew has really thrown us into the deep end, expecting us to have completed five tutorials already. One more, <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/event_reporter.html">EventReporter</a>, is due at the beginning of day nine.</p>

<p>What we&rsquo;ve already done:</p>

<ul>
<li><a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/ruby_in_100_minutes.html">Ruby In 100 Minutes</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html">EventManager</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/encryptor.html">Encryptor</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/microblogger.html">MicroBlogger</a></li>
<li><a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/academy/workshops/testing_event_manager.html">TDD With MiniTest And EventManager</a></li>
</ul>


<p>This last tutorial was yesterday&rsquo;s project. I was really excited to get into writing some tests. We talked about testing in class, and the consensus was that Test Driven Development did lots of good things for programmers. Some of the students&#8217; explanations of testing included: it helps make sure the application is working, it helps guide the developer to the next features that need to be implemented, it describes the application. I am excited to start including it in my workflow, because all of the error-driven clicking and typing I&rsquo;ve been doing up until now is getting really old.</p>

<p>Before bootcamp started, I worked through all of these tutorials on my own, and wrote <a href="https://github.com/fluxusfrequency/treebook.git">my own copy</a> of the Treebook tutorial on <a href="http://www.teamtreehouse.com">Treehouse</a> as well. While completing Treebook, Jason Siefer walks you through a lot of TDD, first using MiniTest, and later Rspec and the Shoulda gem. Now that I&rsquo;m digging into testing without the support of a tutorial, I&rsquo;m trying to decide which syntax I like best for testing. Although it is the simplest, I&rsquo;m not a huge fan of code like this:</p>

<p>I noticed last night that my fellow student, Katrina Engelstad, tweeted a link to this <a href="http://www.mattsears.com/articles/2011/12/10/minitest-quick-reference">blog post</a> by Matt Sears. It looks like a useful reference for MiniTest. Here&rsquo;s a block of code from that page which shows a way to make MiniTest behave like Rspec:</p>

<p>Finally, I&rsquo;ve been tantalized by the possibilities of <a href="http://cukes.info/">Cucumber</a>. I haven&rsquo;t had time to dig into this testing approach yet, but the prospect of writing language like this is very appealing:</p>

<p>For now, even though I think it&rsquo;s ugly, I&rsquo;m going to stick to MiniTest for the &ldquo;TDD with MiniTest and EventManager&rdquo; and EventReporter tutorials, since I am still getting comfortable with TDD. Overlearning MiniTest will be a good foundation to have, even if I end up using Rspec or Cucumber in the future. So long for now! I&rsquo;m off to go implement some fifty odd tests for EventReporter.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Today, I hacked all day long at gSchool. The morning was spent working on the <a href="tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/encryptor.html">Encryptor tutorial</a> with my classmate, Meeka Gayhart. I&rsquo;d worked through this tutorial before, and felt a lot more comfortable with it this time around. The first time I did it, I created a little command line <a href="https://github.com/fluxusfrequency/encryptor.git">program</a> for it, which was super fun. Unfortunately, Meeka and I didn&rsquo;t have enough time to do that this morning.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, Rolen and I continued to work on the <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html">Event Manager tutorial</a> as a pair. We finished all of the iterations, then moved on to refactoring the code. Thanks to the Github forking and merging we figured out yesterday, we were able to switch off as the active coder throughout the afternoon, while the other collaborated over Screen Hero again. Unfortunately, I had to leave before we could finish, so we decided to finish up the refactoring separately. In the morning, we&rsquo;re going to compare our solutions.</p>

<p>The place where we left off was particularly interesting. The tutorial ends after walking you through the creation of a very messy file that has all kinds of methods and variables in it. We opted to try splitting the whole project into separate class files that are then required by the main ruby file. It&rsquo;s my understanding that this is part of what Object Oriented Programming is all about. I&rsquo;m definitely still a noob, so this was a way to take things a little further and challenge myself. Our decision to use Github was also motivated by this desire.</p>

<p>Toward the end of the day, Jeff led the class in a &ldquo;mini retrospective&rdquo;. I got a chance to hearing most of my classmates&#8217; reactions to the bootcamp so far. The process was a confirmation of my impressions: many of us are feeling like we&rsquo;ve been totally thrown into the deep end with these first couple of projects, but also feel like we&rsquo;re up for the challenge. Many also expressed being very impressed with the rest of the students. Everyone seems to be really intelligent, driven, personable, and fun to be around.</p>

<p>I had a great experience today. Although I was super tired (insomnia!), the hours just flew by. I can&rsquo;t wait for tomorrow, when I&rsquo;ll do it all again.</p>

  <div class="entry-content"><p>Yesterday marked the beginning of gSchool for myself and 25 comrades. We were thrown into the fire on Monday with a full day of improv provdied by The Improv Effect. It was a great way to start things off. Although I felt resistant to having to act, and was really eager to start coding right away, the activities really helped me to get to know my new classmates. I&rsquo;m pretty sure I learned every single name, and got a taste of everyone&rsquo;s personality.</p>

<p>Today, we finally got to sink our teeth into some code. We spent the morning going over the procedures we&rsquo;d be following, and listening to Jeff Casimir (the principal of Jumpstart Lab and of the program) tell stories about the history of himself, and of Ruby and the Ruby community. I was really interested in the &ldquo;Pomodoro Method&rdquo; that we&rsquo;re using: 25 minutes of work time spent on a single task, followed by a 5 minute break in which you do something completely different. I think it&rsquo;s great since people&rsquo;s attention spans are so short - they told me adults maxed out at about 20 minutes when I was in Education training. Besides, it&rsquo;s good for us to get up and move around. I used pomodoros for the rest of the day.</p>

<p>In the afternoon, I had my first pair programming experience with classmate Rolen Le. It was a lot of fun. I also found it really challenging, because I&rsquo;ve gotten so used to writing code on my own in the last five months as I&rsquo;ve been preparing to start gSchool. We worked on the <a href="http://tutorials.jumpstartlab.com/projects/eventmanager.html">Event Manager tutorial</a> and got through everything but the iterations. We decided to do everything via GitHub and switch off, which went great until we discovered we didn&rsquo;t really know how to use forking and pull requests! We figured out how to merge branches, though, so at least we each have a repo with the updated code in it.</p>

<p>We were also using Screen Hero to do screen sharing. I think that app will come in very helpful in the future if I have to collaborate with someone remotely (since I am commuting and have to leave early each day). Earlier, I also discovered Quicksilver, when one of my classmates was trying to figure out if there was a keyboard shortcut for Terminal in OS X. Answer: no, but you can create one with Automator and Keyboard Shortcuts in System Preferences. However, Quicksilver does the same thing much more easily, and can do the same for any other program you use often, with ease.</p>

<p>All in all, it was an awesome day of discoveries: Pomodoro, pairing, merging branches on Github, Screen Hero, Quicksilver. Not bad for the first day of actual coding.</p>
