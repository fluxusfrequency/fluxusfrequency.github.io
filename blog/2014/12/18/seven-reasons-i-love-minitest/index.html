<div class="entry-content"><p>This post originally appeared on <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2014/seven-reasons-i-love-minitest">Engine Yard</a>.
It was also a featured article in <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/issues/225">Ruby Weekly</a>.</p>

<p>The other day at our company standup, I mentioned that I was eager to read an article on [Concurrency in Minitest] (<a href="http://chriskottom.com/blog/2014/10/exploring-minitest-concurrency/">http://chriskottom.com/blog/2014/10/exploring-minitest-concurrency/</a>) that was featured in <a href="http://rubyweekly.com/issues/216">Ruby Weekly</a>. One of my coworkers asked: &ldquo;people still use Minitest?&rdquo; My reply: &ldquo;you mean you&rsquo;re not using Minitest yet?&rdquo;</p>

<p>I love Minitest. It&rsquo;s small, lightweight, and ships with Ruby. It&rsquo;s used by respected programmers like <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/001-rr-testing-practices-and-tools/">Aaron Patterson</a>, Katrina Owen, Sandi Metz, and of course, DHH. Here&rsquo;s a look at why Minitest remains a powerful and popular choice for testing Ruby code.</p>

<h2>Witness the Firepower of this Fully Armed and Operational Testing Tool</h2>

<p>Although I come from a <a href="http://fluxusfrequency.github.io/blog/2013/10/03/the-history-of-programming-in-the-life-of-russ-lewis/">family of programmers</a>, I entered the profession by going to a bootcamp.  I was a student in the second <a href="http://www.galvanize.it/school/">gSchool</a> class. At that time, it was being taught by <a href="http://jumpstartlab.com/">Jumpstart Lab</a>.  My instructors were <a href="https://twitter.com/j3">Jeff Casimir</a>, <a href="https://twitter.com/franklinwebber">Franklin Webber</a>, and [Katrina Owen] (<a href="https://twitter.com/kytrinyx">https://twitter.com/kytrinyx</a>).</p>

<p>My classmates and I were brought up with TDD from day one. We practiced it in everything we did. The tool we used was Minitest. When it was first introduced, I scoffed a little because of the name.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Why are we using a &lsquo;mini&rsquo; testing framework?  I want to use what the pros use,&rdquo;
I complained to Katrina.</p>

<p>&ldquo;Minitest is a fully-featured testing framework, and is used in plenty of production apps,&rdquo; was her reply.</p>

<p>I&rsquo;ve been using it ever since. Here are seven reasons I think Minitest is the bees&#8217; knees.</p>

<h2>1. It&rsquo;s Simple</h2>

<p>Minitest ships with Ruby because it&rsquo;s easy to understand, and can be written by anyone who knows the language.  I love this simplicity because it makes it easy to focus on designing code.  Just imagine what you want it to do, and write your assertion, and make it pass.</p>

<p>I recently reached out to Katrina to ask her thoughts on what&rsquo;s good about Minitest. Its simplicity was at the top of her list:</p>

<p>&ldquo;It&rsquo;s simpler. There&rsquo;s no &lsquo;magic&rsquo; (just plain Ruby) [&hellip;] When there is &#8220;magic&rdquo; then it&rsquo;s very easy to assume that you <em>can&rsquo;t</em> understand it [&hellip;] You can read through the [Minitest] source code, and understand what is going on.&#8221;</p>

<p>I also asked Sandi Metz what she thought of Minitest. She said:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Minitest is wonderfully simple and encourages this same simplicity in tests and code.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Minitest is low in sugar. All you need to know is <code>assert</code> for booleans, and <code>assert_equal</code> for everything else. If you want to test a negative case, use <code>refute</code> or <code>refute_equal</code> instead. For everything else, just write Ruby.</p>

<h2>2. It&rsquo;s Extensible</h2>

<p>The relatively &ldquo;low-level&rdquo; status of Minitest makes it easy to customize tests. Katrina observes:</p>

<p>&ldquo;Because Minitest is so simple, it&rsquo;s not too hard to extend. It feels like a tool that I can shape to my needs, rather than a tool that I need to use the way it was intended.&rdquo;</p>

<p>If you want to repeat an assertion in multiple contexts, you can write a custom assertion for it, and call it in as many tests as you need.</p>

</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you are testing something that requires nearly the same test to be run repeatedly, for example when testing a controller that has a user authentication <code>before_action</code>, you can create a shared example by <a href="https://canaryup.com/blog/shared-examples-with-minitest">including a module</a>.</p>

<p>If you need even more control, you can create an object with custom behavior that inherits from <code>Minitest::Test</code>, and have your tests inherit from it. Doing so allows you to completely customize your test suite with new methods as you see fit.</p>

<p>Finally, Minitest comes with hooks to help you easily write extensions to the gem. You can define a plugin by adding a <code>minitest/XXX_plugin.rb</code> file to your project folder, and Minitest will automatically find and require it. You can use extensions to define command-line options, custom reporters, and anything else you want Minitest to be able to do.</p>

<h2>3. It&rsquo;s Flat If You Use Assert</h2>

<p>The default syntax for Minitest is <code>assert</code>. Although the BDD <code>expect</code> syntax is available in <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/blob/master/lib/minitest/spec.rb">mintest/spec</a>, I recommend giving <code>assert</code> a try. Maybe you love expectations because they read like English, sort of. Although <code>assert</code> doesn&rsquo;t try to imitate natural language, it&rsquo;s actually quite intuitive to use. It also provides the benefit of making your test files flat.</p>

<p>With nested <code>context</code>, <code>describe</code>, and <code>it</code> blocks, it can be difficult to remember what <code>it</code> refers to, and which <code>before</code> blocks are accessible in your scope. I find myself scanning indentation in BDD tests to figure out what scope I&rsquo;m working in.</p>

<p>When you use <code>assert</code> syntax, your test file is flat. You start with a test class, then you write a bunch of test methods inside of it. It&rsquo;s clear that the only variables available are those defined in the <code>setup</code> method or in the test itself. This flatness also means it gets painful quickly if your test is tied to too many dependencies. As Katrina puts it, &ldquo;the lack of nested contexts means that I&rsquo;m faced with the appropriate amount of pain when I make bad choices. It quickly becomes ugly if I have too many dependencies. I like that.&rdquo;</p>

<p>Using <code>assert</code> also makes it easy to document the desired behavior of your code: just name the test method to describe what you are testing. If you&rsquo;re really worried you&rsquo;ll forget what the test was for, you can output a message to the console if the test fails:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>

<span class='line-number'>5</span>
<span class='line-number'>6</span>
<span class='line-number'>7</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">test</span> <span class="s1">&#39;it calculates the air-speed velocity of an unladen swallow&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>

</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="s1">&#39;11 MPS&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">actual</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="n">swallow</span><span class="o">.</span><span class="n">average_speed</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">assert_equal</span> <span class="n">expected</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">actual</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="s1">&#39;The average speed of an unladen</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="s1">    swallow was incorrect&#39;</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>Minitest&rsquo;s flatness is also beneficial when it comes to practicing a Test-Driven workflow. You can <code>skip</code> all of the tests in a file easily, without scanning through nested blocks. Then you can make them pass, one at a time.</p>

<h2>4. It Lends Itself to A Good Test-Driven Workflow</h2>

<p>Minitest is awesome for getting into a red/green/refactor loop. Write a test, watch it fail, make it pass, refactor. Repeat. A Minitest file is just a list of tests that are waiting for you to make them pass.</p>

<p>Plus, since you&rsquo;re just writing Ruby, you can use a style like this to get the next test set up with a minimum of effort:</p>

<figure class='code'><figcaption><span></span></figcaption><div class="highlight"><table><tr><td class="gutter"><pre class="line-numbers"><span class='line-number'>1</span>
<span class='line-number'>2</span>
<span class='line-number'>3</span>
<span class='line-number'>4</span>
<span class='line-number'>5</span>
</pre></td><td class='code'><pre><code class='ruby'><span class='line'><span class="nb">test</span> <span class="s1">&#39;something&#39;</span> <span class="k">do</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">expected</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="c1"># some code</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">actual</span> <span class="o">=</span> <span class="c1"># some simple result</span>
</span><span class='line'>  <span class="n">assert_equal</span> <span class="n">expected</span><span class="p">,</span> <span class="n">actual</span>
</span><span class='line'><span class="k">end</span>
</span></code></pre></td></tr></table></div></figure>


<p>If you want to repeat an assertion in different contexts, you can write a method for it, and call it in as many tests as you want to. Need a <a href="https://canaryup.com/blog/shared-examples-with-minitest">shared example</a>? Include a module.</p>

<h2>5. Minitest::Benchmark is Awesome</h2>

<p>If you are dealing with large amounts of data, and performance is a concern, <a href="https://github.com/seattlerb/minitest/blob/master/lib/minitest/benchmark.rb">Minitest::Benchmark</a> is your new best friend.</p>

<p>It lets you test your algorithms in a repeatable manner, to make sure that their algorithmic efficiency don&rsquo;t accidentally get changed. You can collect benchmarks in &ldquo;tab-separated format, making it easy to paste into a spreadsheet for graphing or further analysis&rdquo;.</p>

<p>Here are a few of the assertions in Minitest::Benchmark that might be of interest:</p>

<ul>
<li><code>assert_performance_constant</code></li>
<li><code>assert_performance_exponential</code></li>
<li><code>assert_performance_logarithmic</code></li>
<li><code>assert_performance_linear</code></li>
</ul>


<h2>6. It&rsquo;s Randomized By Default</h2>

<p>Running the tests in a different order each time can help catch bugs caused by unintended dependencies between examples. Here&rsquo;s how Aaron Patterson described the benefit of randomized tests in an <a href="http://rubyrogues.com/001-rr-testing-practices-and-tools/">episode of Ruby Rogues</a>:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I’m sure you’ve been in a situation where your [&hellip;] test fails in isolation, but when you run [the entire test suite] it works. [T]hat’s typically because one test set up some particular environment that another test depended on. [&hellip;] Since Minitest runs the test in a random order, you can’t make one test depend another, so you’ll see an error case.&rdquo;</p>

<h2>7. It&rsquo;s Faster</h2>

<p>Minitest doesn&rsquo;t create any matchers or example objects that have to be garbage collected. Many people have benchmarked Minitest against other frameworks, and it usually comes out at ahead. Often it&rsquo;s a marginal difference, but sometimes it comes out <a href="http://blog.rawonrails.com/2012/01/very-cursory-test-of-rspec-28-speed.html">significantly ahead</a>.</p>

<p>Minitest also supports concurrent test runs. Although I thought this would lead to great speed gains, it turns out that it <a href="http://chriskottom.com/blog/2014/10/exploring-minitest-concurrency/">only makes a difference in JRuby and Rubinius</a>. The Matz Ruby Implementation (MRI) <a href="https://blog.engineyard.com/2010/concurrency-real-and-imagined-in-mri-threads">doesn&rsquo;t get speed gains</a> when using concurrency. Still, it&rsquo;s nice to know that the option is there, in case you are using JRuby or Rubinius, or the MRI changes in the future.</p>

<h2>Have You Tried It?</h2>

<p>I&rsquo;ve talked to a lot of people that are surprised when I say I prefer Minitest. They often ask, &ldquo;why should I switch to Minitest?&rdquo; Perhaps a better question to ask is this one, posed by <a href="https://github.com/metaskills/holy_grail_harness/issues/3">Ken Collins</a>: &ldquo;What is in [other testing frameworks] that you need that Minitest does not offer?&rdquo;</p>

<p>Programming tools are a matter of individual taste. When I&rsquo;ve asked programmers about Minitest, they&rsquo;ve all expressed that they were not <em>against</em> RSpec or other frameworks. Sandi Metz said: &ldquo;I&rsquo;m agnostic about testing frameworks [&hellip;] I also use RSpec and I find it equally useful in it&rsquo;s own way.&rdquo; Katrina Owen said: &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t dislike RSpec, but I do prefer Minitest.&rdquo; In the end, I think most would agree that testing frameworks are a personal choice.</p>

<p>That said, if you haven&rsquo;t used Minitest lately (or ever), why not check it out?  If you&rsquo;re curious, but feel like you still need some convincing, just try it!  It&rsquo;s a small investment. You&rsquo;ll be up and running in a few minutes. Why not go try the first Ruby <a href="http://exercism.io/getting-started">Exercism</a>?</p>

<p>I hope this tour of Minitest&rsquo;s features has been informative, and piqued your interest in this fabulous test framework. Is there anything I missed? Disagree? Let&rsquo;s talk! Please share your point of view in the comments section, or tweet at me at @fluxusfrequency.</p>
