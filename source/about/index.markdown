Hi, my name is Ben Lewis. I'm a full stack developer from Boulder, CO. I work for [Twitter](http://www.twitter.com) as a software developer and consultant.

I write Ruby, JavaScript, Python and Scala code to build and maintain large-scale web applications. Some of my development interests include applying algorithms to handle large amounts of data, visual art, Service-Oriented Architecture, and TDD. I've contributed to [exercism.io](www.exercism.io) and other open source projects.

Although I'm a third generation programmer, I've lived many lives. I hold a B.A. in Music from Vassar College. Before joining the software world, I was a farmer, gardener, elementary school music teacher, and professional bluegrass fiddler. In 2013-2014, I [gSchool](http://www.galvanize.it/school/), learning from Jeff Casimir, Katrina Owen, Franklin Webber of [Jumpstart Lab](www.jumpstartlab.com). When I'm not programming, you'll find me rock climbing, playing fiddle, hiking, and raising my four-year-old daughter, Lumin.

Drop me a line if you ever want to talk. Here's how to find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/fluxusfrequency/) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fluxusfrequency).
