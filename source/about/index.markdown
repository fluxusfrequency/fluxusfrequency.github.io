Hi, my name is Ben Lewis. I'm a full stack developer from Boulder, CO. I work for [Quick Left](http://www.quickleft.com). Here's how to find me on [GitHub](https://github.com/fluxusfrequency/) and follow me on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/fluxusfrequency).

I write Ruby, JavaScript and Python code, using or disregarding whatever frameworks and libraries are appropriate to the job at hand. Some of my development interests include Service Oriented Architecture, Testing, and Scriting and Scraping. I contribute to [exercism.io](www.exercism.io) and other open source projects.

Although I'm a third generation programmer, I've lived many lives. I hold a B.A. in Music from Vassar College. Before joining the software world, I was a farmer, gardener, elementary school music teacher, and professional bluegrass fiddler. In 2013-2014, I attended a six month bootcamp called [gSchool](http://www.galvanize.it/school/). At the time, it was taught by [Jumpstart Lab](www.jumpstartlab.com), which was comprised of Jeff Casimir, Katrina Owen, Franklin Webber, and Jorge Tillez. Over the course of six months, my classmates and I went from total novices to professional developers. Drop me a line if you want to talk about it.
